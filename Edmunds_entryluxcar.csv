0,m6user,June 2013,"That's why I said given the same scenario as we have in the U.S. most Euros would probably want the same things we do. Long distance travel, wide roads, long commutes, cheap gas all add up to big incentives for the big engined, big road machines we grew up with. You're making the same argument I am but in reverse.

So many post ""Americans just have to have big HP or big cars"" and the underlying insinuation that it IS some kind of character flaw. We are all human beings and pretty much reacting to the situation we are in and given the same circumstances most people from anywhere in the world would behave similarly IMO.

But I guess there are the ""enlightened"" few that would drive a Prius if gas was less than $1 gal. and I don't think any single country would have a monopoly on them. LOL. Of course, if gas had never rose above a $1 a gal would there even be a Prius???"
1,fedlawman,June 2013,"Semantics, really, and I do see your point, but Im not sure I completely agree with you. There are, after all, many Americans who choose to drive smaller cars because they are more fun, handle better, or whatever other reasons.

Maybe I'm contradicting myself, but all things being equal, I think many people would still choose to own a small car. Many Europeans and Americans alike do this as a matter of personal preference not because they are forced or encouraged by government restrictions or taxes.

I guess I am a good example of this. I just went down the list of cars I've owned over my entire driving lifetime (15 cars over 30 years), and only two of them had/has an engine larger than 2.5L. Looking at my list even closer, half of them were 2.0L or smaller. I'm sure many many European drivers share my love for small nimble cars."
2,m6user,June 2013,"No, i think we agree in general and that's pretty much what I'm talking about.....in general and we are talking somewhat historically here. The scenario regarding gas prices in this country has changed greatly during the past 5 years so going forward a lot of smaller choices are going to made. There are always exceptions to any rule and different degrees of difference. But, again and in general, I think Americas love affair with big HP and big cars stemmed from the vast size and open spaces that were available when the auto came into being in this country. The scenario you describe(narrow roads, congestion, short travel distances and eventually high fuel prices) for Europe was like that for years and years before the auto made it debut.

I think I've only owned one car with over 300 hp but I have owned several V8s and still have a V8 pickup that gets used sparingly while my I4 gets the bulk of the miles. I think my 68 Mustang V8 was rated at less than 200hp."
3,fedlawman,June 2013,"So this begs the question, before the automobile did Europeans ride smaller horses?

Out of all my cars, only 2 had over 200 hp. None reached 300 hp."
4,dino001,June 2013,"I agree with your previous statement. Many people often insinuate the Europeans drive those small cars with small engines because they are such caring creatures and Americans love their obscenely huge cars with insanely large engines because they are such fill the blank. I do believe there is large amount of excess and waste in so-called American way of life. However, I also believe everybody else in the world would have done the same if given a chance.

On fuel price subject, I think it is fair to expect significant changes in domestic market. While crude price went up the same for everybody, gas prices went up more here than anywhere else, in relative terms. This is because in other countries taxes are much higher percentage of the price (up to 80%) and most of which is flat portion. In other words, insane taxation of fuel in Europe causing high prices at the first place, cushioned the gas price runup when crude over quadrupled from in 2000s. American consumer on the other hand saw every move in crude translated to almost equally proportional move in gas price. Suddenly, those who owned Explorers and Blazers, as their family and commuting cars could not bear the increased cost. So I think we will see significant convergence of the markets. Europeans are liking those taller crossovers almost as much as Americans (many just can't afford them) and Americans will have to learn to like fewer cubic inches, cylinders and even less space in certain conditions.

5,graphicguy,June 2013,"I know quite a few Europeans who either own American muscle cars (at no small expense to buy, import and operate in Europe), or prefer larger Jags and BMWs as their preferred daily drivers.

Not so certain they like the fact that they have to drive diesels or (relatively) underpowered cars. But, their gov'ts dictate that they do so, either with taxes and tarrifs or by supporting much higher fuel prices.

That said, the U.K. is looking at price fixing by at least Shell and B.P....

6,Kirstie_H,June 2013,"There's not just a financial incentive for owning a small car in Europe. If you've ever driven in a fairly large European city, you know that parking can be an absolute nightmare. Finding a parking place for even a midsize sedan can be a challenge, but you can often find on-street parallel parking that you can squeeze a tiny car into. I had a Nissan Micra when I was in the London area a few years ago, which was awful on motorways (drive to Newcastle = not fun), not great on ""a""' roads, but great for tight parking spots and tiny ""b"" roads.

Same sometimes when living out in the sticks. My ex in-laws lived way out, and it was a 10-mile jaunt on a mostly dirt road with giant hedgerows on either side, and the road itself was wide enough for about 1.5 vehicles. If you met an oncoming vehicle, you had to pull off til the passenger side of the vehicle was pretty firmly against the hedgerow. So, my ex in-laws, flush with money, owned a tiny vehicle for those purposes.

7,xrunner2,June 2013,"I'm not certain how well diesels will play in the ELLPS category, specifically the ""Performance"" portion, but the lowly VW definitely had the NVH within range of near-luxury specs.

Can understand their use in Europe, but wonder why some might want a diesel in an ELLPS in the U.S. Unless travel and commutes pass truck stops, then not easy to find diesel.

I have a JD tractor with a diesel engine and there are only 2 gas stations in an 8 mile radius that sell diesel. Of course, I pick up the fuel in 5 gallon containers. One thing that future diesel car owners should know is that the area around the pumps, concrete pavement, pump handle, everything is oily, messy and dirty. Make sure you have extra paper towels to clean your hands, and maybe shoe bottoms, in case the gas station does not have same in nearby dispenser."
8,dino001,June 2013,"True, parking spaces are smaller. Even turn radii in places like parking garages can be just insane. I remember one in Cologne - there was a post in the middle of exit curve with a rainbow of colors from paint transfers.

9,graphicguy,June 2013,"I used to drive in Manchester quite a bit. Not only is parking crazy, they park any way they want, wrong side, pointed the wrong direction. Of course, I saw quite a few fender benders as a result.

I concur with Dino....Euro drivers don't drive small cars because they want to, or out of some misguided sense of environmentalism. They drive them because there's either no room for a more comfortable car, or they can't park them.

10,graphicguy,June 2013,"Those of us in the U.S. can't find the financial value equation to support diesels. Plus, we like high revving motors. Diesels do have good low end torque, but run out of steam quickly. They'll never be more than a small niche here. Hybrids, plug-in hybrids, clean gas engines do as well, mostly better than diesels.

I saw a study recently stating that 50% of U.S. cars will be some form of hybrid or an electric car by 2025. That's only 12 years from now. Diesels won't have a place at that table.

'15 Audi Misano Red Pearl S4, '16 Audi TTS Daytona Gray Pearl, Wife's '19 VW Tiguan SEL 4-Motion"
12,markcincinnati,June 2013,"Yesterday, our local Infiniti store had a ""party"" of sorts for the 2014 Q50. Food, drink, customized wine glasses and a 4MB thumb drive key-chain were the ""Thanks for coming"" gifts offered to this -- public invited -- coming out party for the new Q50.

Overall, I would say the event was under-attended. Although there was some mention of the event in the local Cincinnati newspaper, no special invitation to current Infiniti owners was sent out (we have a 2011 FX35 coming off lease in about 6 months).

Present at the event: the Infiniti dealership sales team, one factory rep and one ""marketing rep"" (a representative of a company hired by Infiniti to test the Q50 against an Audi A4 and a BMW 3 series.) My wife and I stayed for about an hour (of the four hour show) -- a ""pre-production"" Q50S w/AWD fully optioned was on display and we were encouraged to try out the front and rear seats and especially to get behind the wheel. The car had been used throughout the day to train the reps -- and it had been, according to the factory rep, driven hard by some of the more adventurous Infiniti sales team members.

The car -- no matter if you think it is attractive or not -- is different looking (by far) from the pictures many of us have seen in print and on-line. My impression of the in-person view is that the Q50 exterior is beautiful. The interior is Audi-nice -- which is about as high of a compliment as I can give for anyone's automotive interior rendering.

The dash, the electronics, the gauges, pedals, switch gear, etc etc etc are all ""jewel-like"" -- the interior is a major upgrade over even the current M cars -- in fact, the new Q50 has to be the nicest Infiniti (inside and out) ever.

My wife -- a conservative attorney, not subject to hyper-ventalating -- remarked ""this may very well be a game changer for Infinti."" My comment -- written here previously -- to the factory rep was that Infinti will know it has ""arrived"" when Car & Driver, et al, proclaim the BMW 3 series as ""the German Infiniti,"" since, thus far, the praise heaped on Infiniti's G cars goes something like ""Infiniti's G37, the Japanese BMW.""

We'll know if Infiniti has knocked it out of the park when the shoe is on the other foot.

The Q50 according to the marketing representative was track-tested against an Audi A4 2.0T with sport package and against a BMW 328i (with x-drive) also with sport package.

Now, at first blush, this seems like an unfair comparison: the Infiniti has a 325+ HP V6, HUGE brakes (with 4-piston stoppers on the front) and sport everything. By comparison, the two Germans were equipped with their manufacturer's turbo 4s and sport packages.

One look at the specs of the three compared cars, and the Germans appear totally out-gunned. It's no wonder, then, that the Infiniti Q50S out accelerated, out handled -- out ran, overall -- the boys from the Fatherland. I asked the Infiniti factory rep why they didn't compare the Q50 to an Audi S4 or a BMW 335, since the specifications of the Infiniti would seem to call for the German hot rods to be able to call it a fair fight.

The answer from the Infiniti factory rep was that they compared similar sized cars, similar ""class"" cars, similarly equipped (lux options) cars at the same price points. For the Germans to be completely equipped and comparable to the Infiniti would have meant checking off the S4 and 335 variants of the Audi and BMW respectively.

Infinti reckons -- apparently -- that a $51,000+ Q50S AWD can be compared against an Audi A4 or BMW 3 series only if the Audi and BMW are equipped with their turbo 4-cylinders. The apples to apples comparison would require the $51,000 Q50S to be compared with an Audi or BMW that would cost between $10,000 and $12,000 more.

Infiniti hopes (I assume) that Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend and Road & Track will see the light and only test the Q50 against other cars based on price. Based on my years of reading these enthusiasts magazines, I'd wager the Q50 will be compared to S4's and 335i's and price be damned.

However, against what can be had from a German sports sedan for $51,000, there's little doubt in my mind that the $51,000 Infiniti Q50 will kick their butts.

The factory rep said the target buyer is someone who will consider an Audi A4 or BMW 3 and the new Lexus IS. ""Not so much comparison is likely to happen with the Q50 against the Cadillac ATS or the Mercedes C,"" so says the factory rep.

After absorbing about as much as one person can, without a test drive, we then went over about three doors to the Lexus dealer where a new IS 350 F-Sport AWD was on-display. Like the Q50, the IS350 looks different in person -- but unlike the Q50, the IS 350 is LESS attractive (to me, at least) in person -- yet there is something that MAY make the 350 more attractive: its price. A well optioned 2014 Lexus IS 350 AWD F-Sport was $48,000 including shipping. Infiniti may need to consider sub-venting their lease offerings -- since the IS350 does seem to be a worthy rival.

In pictures, the IS's interior wins -- in person, it appears more ""industrial"" and, for me that translates to, less attractive -- your mileage may differ.

We're at a point-of-inflection here folks -- two mighty fine cars have power-slided onto the scene. Updated Audis and BMW's better be in the queue REAL SOON. :surprise:"

15,markcincinnati,June 2013,"Dealer rep tells me: Q50's (AWD only unless special ordered with a customer's name attached) will be ""available"" on or about July 25th. Oh, OK?

Wait, wait -- from a practical perspective, the rep says ""inventory"" will be available closer to the end of August, beginning of September (in the Cincinnati market).

I assume that some top-10 cities will have cars on July 26th. Being in a second-tier city, we'll have to wait our turn.

Dealer rep tells me they have 11 inventory cars on order and some number of ""customer pre-order cars"" coming in.

I understand WHY -- in Cincinnati -- we would only get the AWD versions, but the news to me was that only ""sold orders"" for RWD versions will be sent to dealers.

Me? I'm not interested in the RWD version, since we simply have too many days where the coefficient of friction is low -- but I can't imagine (even in Cincinnati) there wouldn't be a market for an RWD Q50.

Not the right forum, I know, but my wife announced to me her choices to replace her 2011 FX35; she has it down to a 2014 Audi Q5 or a 2014 ""FX37"" or QX70 as we think it will be called -- the BMW X3 is plan ""C"" apparently. :surprise:"

19,markcincinnati,June 2013,"I have read ALL of the car magazines regarding the engine (3.7L) and the transmission (7spd auto ONLY, manual dropped altogether).

They all say the engine/trans are ""carried over"" from the 2013 G37.

The ""brief, very, very brief"" literature handed out at the Q50 Party said ONLY the following HP 325+.

The G37 for 2013 says -- on the window sticker -- 328 HP.

I cannot imagine 325+ won't translate to a firm number: 328 -- but I've been wrong before.

The dealer and the factory rep did say that Gas Mileage on the new Q50 with the 3.7L was ""better."" The factory rep also said the hybrid (which uses the 'old' 3.5L V6 + help from electric motivation) is the quickest and fastest of the new Q50 lineup and that it gets ""much better"" fuel economy than the outgoing G37. Somewhere I read the hybrid's HP is 350+.

Net net: new Q50 has an incrementally improved 3.7L engine that has about the same power as the outgoing G37 model, plus better MPGs.

21,igozoomzoom,June 2013,"I've been helping my mom's best friend shop for a new vehicle to replace her leased 2010 Infiniti G37. Her lease expires on July 10th, so we're down to just a few weeks.

We looked at the 2013 Acura TL 3.5 'Base' and she liked it (drives great, awesome interior, but the exterior is still fugly to me)! They are offering the following lease deal-

$2499 due at lease signing ($2200 down, $299 first payment)
$299/month for 30 months
30k miles allowed, $0.20/mile overage

We also went to the Infiniti dealership and they offered the following-

2013 Infiniti G37 Journey 4-door w/ Premium Pkg
$2499 due at lease signing ($2200 down, $299 first payment)
$299/month for 24 months
24k miles allowed, $0.25/mile overage

She is currently paying just over $400/month and her goal is around $300/month and she's willing to put down around $2000. So both of these fit the bill.

The only other car that she really liked isn't quite an entry-level luxury car, but still very impressive, IMO. She loves the 2014 Mazda6 i Grand Touring. A 36-month lease with $2000 down would be around $280/month.

Any other suggestions for near-luxury or entry-level luxury cars that would fit within her budget of $2000-ish down and $300/month?

The Volvo S60 is an a very good car- looks good, drives good, good value depending on model/options. The Acura TL, even with the DESPERATELY NEEDED 2012 nose job and butt lift, is still not an appealing design...not as ugly as the 2009 TL, but few if any cars are uglier than that!

At the height of its popularity, the TL sold 78,218 units in 2005. Even the 2008 model sold 48,766 cars. But the 2009-2012 TL has only sold in the low 30s each year, topping out at 34,049 in 2010.

2013 YTD Figures at May EOM aren't looking very good either. So far, the TL has sold 12,434 units this year which is down 15.3% (or 2242 units) compared to this time last year.

My beloved, but ignored and soon to be discontinued, TSX is faring much worse. Year to date, it has only sold 7,746 compared to 15,012 at this point in 2012. That's a decrease of 48.4% or 7266 fewer cars.

The ILX is hardly setting any records, but it has sold 9,217 units YTD. That is almost 2000 more sales than the TSX has lost compared to last year, so people are obviously buying the ILX instead of the TSX. But the ILX desperately needs to replace the underpowered 150hp 2.0L engine used in all models with the 5-speed A/T! I've driven a 2013 ILX Premium with the 2.0L 5AT and I was genuinely impressed with the car until I pulled onto the highway! 0-60mph takes 9.5 seconds, dead-even with the Kia Rio and Hyundai Accent with 6-speed A/T! Even the cheap-as-dirt Nissan Versa 1.6 CVT can hang neck-and-neck at 9.8 seconds.

That kind of performance is tolerable, if mediocre, on a $15k car. But on a $30k 'Premium' entry-level luxury or near-luxury model, it's simpy UNACCEPTABLE! Especially from a company that is known for making some great high-performance 4-cylinder engines!

Acura was doing just fine with until 2009 when the godawful ""Power Plenum"" (aka- 'The Shield' and 'The Beak') corporate fascia debuted! Despite immediate negative response from the media and consumers and plunging sales figures, they defiantly insisted that it was the new look of Acura....and it wasn't nor has it been pretty since! =(

I have owned seven Honda/Acura vehicles in my 24 years of driving. I've owned nine different cars in my life, and was a die-hard Honda loyalist from the day I got my license in 1990 until 2006 when I saw the new Civic and walked away! Actually, I drove off the lot in shock and terrified at the prospect of shopping for anything other than a Honda. But after some research and test drives, I found myself right at home with a 2006 Mazda3 and now I have a 2012 CX-9 GT.

But the best car I've ever driven (and the best car ever made, in my humble opinion) was my 1994 Acura Legend L 4-door. I bought it in 1997 when it was returned at the end of a 36-month lease. It was Frost White with Taupe Cloth and 5-speed manual, but that was exactly how I wanted it. I drove until May 2001 when I was t-boned by a speeding F250 work truck running a red light as I was making a left turn. I barely survived, but my Legend did not. =(

It's sad to see Acura where it is today. I've felt much the same way about Honda for the last several years also. But the 2013 Accord is so good and so much better than the 2008-2012 model that it replaced....perhaps there's hope after all?

I honestly think Acura would sell many more cars if they rolled back time and started making their 2006 lineup again...LOL.

The MDX is the only Acura worth a look in its segment right now, and even it is overdue for a refresh."
30,m6user,June 2013,"The RDX is selling very, very well and the MDX is still a very good seller. Guess which models Acura makes more profit on? So sales of certain models doesn't necessarily spell disaster as it's overall profit that counts. Of course making good proift on all your lines is preferable but as long as you're making money it's not exactly like you're going to go out of business. Accords didn't so so well over the past 5 years but several other models like the CRX, Odyssey, Civic and Pilot sold well and with good profit margins.

Bottom line, just looking at sales numbers of a couple of models is a fools delight. Acura is one good redesign away from being on track again with the TL and one good engine to make the ILX a good seller. Along with the very profitable MDX and RDX sales they will be just fine."
31,stickguy,June 2013,"the new MDX came out this week. All new design. Basically a ""supersized"" RDX, with the hi-tech AWD, etc. But same basic platform and drivetrain, just more goodies and room.

they do need to hurry up and redesign the TL/TSX (I believe they are combining the 2 into 1 car) into something competitive and exciting. They can then also tweak the ILX (maybe go to the TSX 2.4l engine/6 speed combo).

the TSX-TL (TSL?) can grow a bit, and offer 4 and V6 like the TSX used to. Or, follow the trend and go NA and Turbo.

The ILX is improved this year (content wise). Pretty much they eliminated the base (strippo) model but kept the price close.

so, there is hope now that they did the ""big"" car, and both SUVs. The other sedans are definitely due, since the TSX was done for 2009 so it is on it's 5th year, and TL the 6th.
2020 Acura RDX tech SH-AWD, 2023 Maverick hybrid Lariat luxury package."
32,sweendogy,June 2013,"While I agree the mdx (and its now a new mdx) and rdx sell well, very well they do not sell in numbers to keep the brand alone- look at the sales numbers for every other car they produce and they are mid pack at best in terms of sales- mind you mid pack means massive discounts and minimal If any profit. Honda on the other hand no matter how bad the previous accord and civic looked they stll were near the top of the sales chain. I would also note that when the last civic was being slammed they quickly fixed it because its the real bread and butter of the brand.

Acura is one good redesign away from selling some cars for sure- but they have to redesign a bunch of cars to do that.

Sales numbers tell the story, they sold 200k crvs in 2011 and when they did a redu they were very careful not to mess that up. Something they failed to do with the tsx and TL."
33,m6user,June 2013,"means massive discounts and minimal If any profit.

You champion solid research all the time....do you have any information that indicates Acura is making ""minimal, if any profit"". If they are midpack then everyone below must be in Chapter 11. I think a little exaggeration is being played here.

but they have to redesign a bunch of cars to do that.

Ummhh...no, just a couple. Where do you get a ""bunch of cars""? They just totally redesigned the MDX, RDX and RLX. The RDX outsells the BMW X3, the Q5 and the EX37. Nothing midpack there. The MDX is right up there in sales with most of them except the RX. The RX has no little brother to share sales with(yet, NX is coming). If it did the MDX and RX would be pretty close in sales IMO. So saying that all their lines are ""midpack"" is probably another exaggeration.

They have the ILX which admittedly needs some tweaking. They already have the 2.4l in the sport model of the ILX. They should just make that the base engine with a 6 spd auto. They are apparently ditching the TSX so the only car they really need to redo completely(and with a pleasing design hopefully) is the TL or whatever they are going to call the replacement for the TL/TSX.

35,igozoomzoom,June 2013,"The MDX is the only Acura worth a look in its segment right now, and even it is overdue for a refresh.

As someone else already mentioned, the redesigned 2014 MDX has just been released in the last week or so. It looks like a 5/4 version of the RDX, but that's not a bad thing based on current RDX sales.

YTD sales of the RDX as of May month end were up 122.1% over the same period in 2012. 18,177 units vs. 8,183 last year!

I applaud Acura for trying something different with the original RDX and using a turbocharged 4-cylinder, but buyers in this segment want smooth V6 power. Just like the Mazda CX-7, a high-performance compact/upscale CUV is interesting in theory but the reality doesn&#146;t quite cut it.

The MDX was definitely due for a significant update after seven years with little change. I test drove a 2012 MDX last November when I was in the market for a 3-row CUV and I still chose the 2012 Mazda CX-9 GT. The MDX stickered for $44k and the CX-9 stickered for $39k and the CX-9 had more features, better handling and the interior materials and assembly quality were also on part with the Acura. The lack of a FWD version of the MDX was also a negative.

The &#145;real&#146; price difference also made my decision much easier. This was in 11/2012 and I could barely get the 2012 MDX for $2500 off sticker (around $41,500). My CX-9 stickered for $38,785 and I drove it off the lot for $29,706 plus sales tax! I paid cash for the CX-9, but probably would have leased the MDX if I had picked it. Grandma was generous in her will, but not THAT generous!

Back to the current and near-future of Acura.the demise of the TSX will take a sedan AND wagon out of the lineup. Will the ILX, TLX and RLX sedans and RDX and MDX crossovers be enough to keep the brand viable and return it to actual relevance?

Then again, Buick is doing well with less- a compact sedan (Verano), a sporty/performance-oriented mid-size sedan (Regal) and near-full-size sedan (LaCrosse) along with a large Crossover (Enclave) and mini-crossover (Encore). In particular, the Encore is a joke compared to the RDX and the LaCrosse is no RLX. But somehow, Buick is more desirable than Acura to most buyers.

37,sweendogy,June 2013,"well M6 - i am the champion for research or atleast I do want a base for strong commentary as opposed to random thoughts.. case in point- the 2013 TL SHAWD with tech pack, we can mosltly agree would be a good example to use- it has a MSRP of over 44k, invoice of 41,6 and according to true car for my area (use 02144) you can get it for 39,588 (3 dealers willing to do this deal) - thats over a 10% discount- the BMW 328 is down 4%, the Audi down 6 and ATS Caddy is 3%.. i just dropped some knowledge on you. I understand you cannot truly tell what they are making or losing on these cars but it tells you something when it comes to discounting and fact is they are not making as much (could be losing?) as they would like given the above figures. second paragraph above- Again as i stated the 2 SUVS sell well, but lets remember how many MDXs are they selling?? 50k last year mdx - very good year -vs the x5s 44,445- the rdx 29,520 again very good year as they avg around 15k since inception the bmw x3 35,173[. BMW sells 100k 3 series in the states vs the tls 33k -- so are they really beating them by that much to justify a TL that sells a third of the 3 series?? lets add in the tsx 28,865 sales from 2012.. so 2 car lines make up HALF of 3 series sales. Acura no longer sells (haha) the ZDX-- they sold 379 RL for 2012. 379 wonder what the margins on the balance sheet on that one are (was). (all numbers above are US numbers).

I stand by my statements from 5 years ago- they need a convertable, a sports coupe, a midlevel sedan with looks, a flagship people want and a supercar (which is comming).. Thats a bunch in my estimation maybe we have differ thoughts on what is alot but when we are talking half a line of cars its alot.

and for billy both sides of the balance sheet need to equal out to make it balance sheet."
38,laurasdada,June 2013,"My prior ride was an 2005 Abyss Blue Acura TL. Other than not so good in the snow (until I bought it snow shoes), what a great all around ride! Simple, handsome exterior, I still think it looks good. Power, handling, good ride, decent mpg, nice interior, well built and reliable. 6.5 years, 85,000 trouble free, Zaino-shiny miles.

When the '09 came out, I was pretty shocked and upset at the path the Acura stylists had taken. While I may be no arbiter of style, I was fairly sure Acura was going to take a hit on TL sales. Of course, the Beak being the most obvious flaw. But the rest of the car just seemed overwrought and heavy-looking to me.

Talking to Acura rep at the New England Auto Show, the first thing he noted was that the beak could be painted to make it less obtrusive. Now, there's a selling point...

We've had several Acura's in my family, nothing but good experiences. I hope that they can reclaim the prior gen TL's glory. And, I'm not sure the RLX will be the answer to anyone's question. Hopefully, a good car, but the styling, IMHO, not so much.

I think you could make some of the same comments about Infiniti. I love Infiniti but they have pulled some real boners too. And some of their models are real low in the sales numbers but they seem to plugging along fairly well without the huge sales numbers....just like Acura. Acura may be doing even better because their SUV sales are better than Infiniti's and that's where a ton of profit is.

51,m6user,June 2013,"what are the numbers, the profit you speak of?? you are saying they are making big profits but have yet to produce one number..

If you read at all about the auto industry you know that manufacturers make big profits off of their truck and suv sales. How much exactly I don't know. But the important thing about that statement is that I don't know exactly. That's why I don't make statements about a companies overall profit or loss. In the case of SUV profits I assumed it was pretty well known or accepted that manufactures back big bucks off of those sales but to be honest I really don't know. I'm not saying that either company is making huge overall profits because I simply don't know. YOU are the one that made statements about Acura profits or lack thereof mainly because of their lack of sales in the TL. You seem to base that theory on the fact that they are offering big discounts on the TL. I don't believe that is enough info to broadly state that Acura is making little to no profit as a company. If you do know then please enlighten us as I have never said that I do.

Re volume, if we were talking about Camrys I would agree that huge volume is absolutely neccessary, but when you are talking about luxury cars I think they can be profitable without selling on volume. There are tons of car companies and most are doing ok even if they are midpack in sales or even on the lower end in sales. Being tops in sales means something I agree, but it's not the only factor when it comes to being a viable business."

Acura needs to fix the appearance of the TL. It doesn't really matter if it performs well and has a nice interior, it is still ugly. I'm driving my '05 TL at 132K miles and I can tell you that I haven't the slightest interest in the new TL. My vintage TL IMHO was one of the nicer looking cars on the road and Acura screwed up big time in going from very handsome to butt ugly (or beak-ugly). Don't underestimate appearance, as few people want to invest that type of money and drive an ugly car.

Then there's the TSX - a car that went from sporty and handsome to not-as-ugly-as-the-TL, but bloated and not sharp handling any more. So Acura blew it on two of their top vehicles. That's a pretty sad story for a lineup that was a lot better 7 years ago than today.

Then again, Buick is doing well with less- a compact sedan (Verano), a sporty/performance-oriented mid-size sedan (Regal) and near-full-size sedan (LaCrosse) along with a large Crossover (Enclave) and mini-crossover (Encore). In particular, the Encore is a joke compared to the RDX and the LaCrosse is no RLX. But somehow, Buick is more desirable than Acura to most buyers.

Well, I'd say the Buicks are actually at least decent looking to attractive. Like I said, don't underestimate the power of ugly to ruin a brand. Buick is getting a lot better and Acura has gone the other direction. While I would never buy a Buick, I can see why they are improving relative to Acura."
61,billyperksii,June 2013,"I passed on the generation TL you are driving because I thought Acura didnt do anything special from the 2nd generation.

I had the 2nd generation Type S and talk about torque steer and horrible in the snow. When they did the mid year refresh with the Type S I was even more disappointed- talking about more Torque steer and horriblw wheels. The current generation sh-awd is worlds apart in driving dynamics to 3rd generation and I never been told that the car is ugly in almost four years of ownership.

When is the TL replacement coming? 2015 MY? Acura dealers are already ""giving them away"" at below invoice prices. Who knows what kind of rebates, conquest cash, trunk money, & cheap financing they will throw the TL's way once they decide to ""fire sale"" in the coming months.

My expectation is that the TL replacement (TLX?) will be introduced very early in calendar year 2014 as a 2015 model.

The recently announced 2013 TL Special Edition model (a 2013 model being introduced in June 2013 makes me wonder if there will be an official 2014 model) is the the kind of ""high value"" upgrade done to generate sales in a model's last days.

The wheels and spoiler really give the car a much nicer look. It only comes in four colors- Black, Pearl White, Silver and Graphite and all have the aforementioned Black Leather.

69,graphicguy,June 2013,"nyc....billy....I mentioned that I just helped my sister buy a TL SH AWD Advance. I had forgotten how really GOOD they are. It seems Acura made some running engineering changes along the way that most wouldn't detect, unless you had an earlier model to compare it to. Given that you can buy one at a decent discount, it would be hard to be in the near luxury market and not seriously consider one.

While I liked the pre -'12 design, I admit the redesign makes the current TL one of the classiest looking cars on the market, currently. Add in the torque vectoring rear giving it high handling limits, and the comfort of the sports seats, and the quality of the materials, and the high build quality, and the great stereo, the uber smooth drivetrain, MPG (She last told me she's getting 22 MPG in town and 28 MPG on the highway), etc. I found it very competitive.

My sister bought hers for right around $40, give or take. That's a whole lot of car/performance for that kind of money. My S4 ran $10K+ over that amount and the TL SH AWD isn't that far off the performance mark (except acceleration, where the S4 will smoke many muscle cars, and the DSG trans).

I think ""markincinnati"" pointed out that he went from an Audi to the TL. At first, I kind of scoffed. But, given the test drive I did with my sister and the TL upgrades, it makes perfect sense, now.

I'm thinking I have another couple of years on my Audi S4 before I start to look again.

The TL(X) will be released in 2015. It's been seen in testing areas under heavy camo. The TSX is going away. My guess is end of this year someone will see one without camo, and release will come roughly 12 months from now.

Given Acura's move towards their 4 wheel steering with the RLX, and the way they take incremental steps in powertrain upgrades, I'm thinking they keep the 3.7, add direct injection, pump out another 10 HP and another 10 ft/lb. My hope is they keep the double wishbone instead of moving to coil overs.

Will I be a buyer? Not sure. Too far away to tell.

But, given what I know about the Benz, the Q, the BMW, Caddy, Audis, etc, I'll put the TL right there with them.

Billy....hard to go wrong with the A6. It is probably close to what you're used to with the TL, sizewise. That Audi 3.0 SC is a sweetheart of a motor, though. The TL 3.7L is fast and smooth too, however.

Good luck in your choice.

I'll counter that the TL is probably still a very profitable profit for Acura/Honda. It's in it's 5th year of production so the tooling has been depreciated. They've perfected the manufacturing which drives down costs. All in all, it makes them plenty of money I'm sure."

79,m6user,June 2013,"Well, the operable word in your counter argument is ""probably"". Which means a guess. I have no idea if Acura can still make money selling the TL well below invoice.

82,sweendogy,June 2013,"so a decline in sales over a period of 6 years (and giving more discounts then its comps) is a good thing for profits and brand? just like the SUV statement you made, Honda as a corporation does not break out margins by product line or atleast ive never seen it, or dont know where to get it, either do you it seems.. so my Opinion (i said it) was an educated one given the data provided.

85,m6user,June 2013,"so a decline in sales over a period of 6 years (and giving more discounts then its comps) is a good thing for profits and brand?

Gee, don't remember saying anything like that. But to answer your question....of course not.

""SUVs became popular in the United States, Canada, India and Australia in the 1990s and early-2000s. U.S. automakers could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per SUV, while losing a few hundred dollars on a compact car.[11] For example, the Ford Excursion could net the company $18,000, while they could not break even with the Ford Focus unless the buyer chose options,[12][13] leading Detroit's big three automakers to focus on SUVs over small cars.""

While this talks about Ford, from everything I've read about margins online, in magazines and in the daily newspapers say the same thing re all automakers. SUVs have much better margins than passenger cars so selling a high proportion mix of SUVs vs. passenger cars should maintain profit margins. Of course, good profit margins on all lines would be preferable. But the fact remains that your statement about Acura having little to no profit was just one big assumption. Good to see you finally admitted that your statement was basically an educated guess which is pretty much what any opinion is. Some are just more educated than others."

just one big assumption not really that big as its backed by sales numbers and discounts that are published.. and the fact that those said discounts are more then the comp and those said sales numbers are a third of its biggest competitor.

we've all seen the SUV type message written in NYT or the NYP--but again you have never produced any numbers to dispute my educated opinion just broad industry chatter that suvs are high margin, wonder how acura did on the margins of the zdx last year when they sold 800, but again but why should we look at sales numbers when we have chatter on the ford focus vs excursion (hasnt been produced since 05) above above. Sales numbers do not tell the whole story- but a better story then you present. sorry"

117,mrminsky1,July 2013,"Reviving this a little because I just bought a TL Special Edition after leasing a 2010 G37 Sedan..... I am aware of Acura highly discounting the vehicle because of the lack of sales and appeal. The TL is a gift for what is being sold for when comparing it to the competition and as wise of a consumer that I am , I happily bought one after comparing all the others. I remember hating the 2009 version when it first came out. Yet, I think they did a great job with the latest model. I think the car is extremely attractive and if anything, it is different to all the cars on the road. Everyhing else look like Sonatas to me. Seriously, I can't tell the difference between a new Sonata and everything else out there. The Lexus ES350 and the GS350 look the same and they look like Sonatas. The Sonata and the Azera look the same. The new Q50 looks like a Sonata from behind. The Mazda 6 looks like a Fusion which looks like a Sonata except for the front grill. All the Buicks look alike and they all look like Sonatas. With the exception of Cadillac and BMW, everything else look like Sonatas

Granted the TL is different and it looks different. I think it is attractive and the interior is nicer than anything I have seen. I like the buttons myself for the same reasons I hate touch screens and mouses. I like the cockpit feel of the car and I love the seats.

I drove pretty much every 4 door sedan and I can honestly tell you that YES, some cars did a better job in certain areas than the TL and some no so great. Looks are very subjective and to each his own. One thing that can't be denied is the value this car offers when compare to others.

I test drove the BMW and AUDI and I am still trying to figure why so many people buy their cars when you consider price and reliability, Trust me , I once I had to bite as well and I learned my lesson well. Having a cup of coffee at the dealership while getting my car fix is not my thing or at least not every other month.

Now getting back to the G37 versus the TL. Well Totally different cars. My G37 was a lot of fun to drive and very reliable. Having said that , the G was smaller and the gas mileage was very poor. If there was one thing that bothered me throughout my ownership was the smell of the AC and the quality of the paint (Google both!) Nothing could cure the smell of mildew on my G. Tried everything including changing filters, spraying stuff, cleaning the AC vents and pan. Nothing! It really sucked and my wife hated getting in my car during the warmer months here in Atlanta. Yet, I still loved driving my G. Excellent car! The TL on the other hand is a larger car and perhaps and a little smoother. I did purchase the Special Edition version which comes with the larger 18 tires which tend to give you a little better grip with a little more of a sportier ride. The Car looks awesome with this new package. But it DOES NOT drive anything like the G. They are different and they should be different. If anyone wants a true sports sedan, the G37 would be the better choice. The TL works for me for different reasons. It is larger, it offers a good compromise between my old G and say a softer ES350. Slightly better gas mileage, more comfortable interior (and nicer) , and an incredible value for what it is....................

By the end of the day, both are great reliable cars which will give you years of true driving pleasure. If you are into resale value, the TL will hold its value better. Both of these cars can be had in the very low $30's depending on the trim level....and they are both deals. But to each his own."

123,graphicguy,August 2013,"andres3....tough choice. I truly love the S4. It's not been ""bullet-proof"", however. It spends some time at the dealer for one thing or another about every other month. Some of the things Audi just can't seem to fix (hiccups in the MMI/B&O audio system is something that's a continued to be troublesome). My Quattro system is binding at slow speeds. They're working on that now (awaiting parts from Germany). There have been several other issues, too.

Is the TL SH AWD equal to the S4? Nope! S4's supercharged motor is a joy. It's muscle car fast, gets decent MPG. The car handles very well and is comfortable.

I mentioned in here that I've owned a couple of TLs, including the '10 version. I never had any issues with the styling. I do think the redesign make the car look a lot better, though. Now, it is quite handsome. My sister just bought a '13 AWD Advance. She says she's getting 22 MPG. Although, I've had just a little seat time in it, Acura seems to have made subtle running changes that makes the car handle better, ride better. Her leather seats feel nicer than what I had in my '10, or what I have in my S4.

The S4's trick DSG trans is the best in the biz. While the TL's trans is better (6-speed), it's no match for the Dual Clutch unit in the Audi.

So, the question...is the S4 worth $10K, $12K, even $15K more than the TL SH AWD? Only you can make that judgement.

I love what the S4 does on the road. I do get weary of taking it to the dealership once every 8 weeks, and being without it 2 days, 4 days, a week at a time (they do give me some slick rides to drive though, including one very sweet TT).

On the other hand, a TL will just drive....no worries.

I'm sure the S4 is a joy to drive(when you have it) but I absolutely would not put up with a $50k+ car that broke every 8 weeks or so. I could care less if the fix is free and I get a cool loaner. It would just be too much of a hassle. I'm sure this may be an extreme case but your experience is the common perception and you know what perception is.......reality.

If I want that I'll spend $20k and get a 4yr old G or TL and still only be in the shop a couple of times a year if that. Hell, my wife's Mazda6 is 6 years old and it has never been in the shop once for repairs. One thing had to be adjusted and that was done at the first oil change. Every single other visit has been for normal, routine maint. So far my new Acura RDX has not been back to the dealer even once in my first 10 months of ownership.

126,andres3,August 2013,"What I've seen from driving TL-SH AWD and looking at the S4 (and knowing it's performance figures).

The TL gets what I consider low mileage, the S4 has 10% more power and 10% better gas mileage to boot. That's probably due to the TL being about 250 lbs. heavier and it is bigger with more leg room, as well as not having a 7th gear like the Audi (nor the efficient dual clutch system).

I do think the new TL's are improved in the looks department, but the styling still leaves me thinking ""plain Jane."" The S4 is a truly beautiful car, and has what appears to me to be a paint job a few notches higher in quality. The S4 offers some color selection (not much) while the TL offers almost none (White Black, and shades in between, along with an ugly purple they call red).

TL Pros: Bigger, more leg room, more rear seat room. Reliable.

S4's Pros: better engine, better transmission, better interior, better exterior, better design, better styling (I realize that's subjective), better color selection, lighter/smaller more nimble.

Frankly, Edmund's TMV puts the TL at $39,500 with the AWD and Tech package. I've looked at all the details, and frankly, Acura in my view should have priced it at $37,000. They did take some shortcuts....

For instance, the roof rails are not body colored .

Also, the 3.7 from Nissan/Inifiniti have about 330 HP, why not Acura's?

The base FWD TL costs $4K more than the Honda Accord V6 and for that you get 2 added HP, 2 less MPG, and a somewhat nicer interior. Just throwing that in there for anyone considering a FWD TL.

As nice as the TL-Tech interior is, the S4's is better. I compared a base TL-AWD w/ the Tech package, and the tech package has nicer perforated leather than the base model, but the S4's Nappa leather was still clearly superior to both (softer and nicer). Yes, I know the Nappa isn't standard.

130,mrminsky1,August 2013,"The msrp the TL was closer to $9000 higher than the Accord. Have you seen the TL SE with some of the nice extras including the leather, wheels, etc?. So yes to me, the premium was worth it. But this is the same question we have been asking for years.

ES350 or Camry (now the Avalon)
TL or Accord
G37 or Maxima or Altima

and since Audi is in question as well, why not get the VW GLI versus an A4 FW? People like to compare all these vehicles to each other and assume that the mainstream ones drive and feel the same as their luxury counterparts. The Answer is no. I drove the Accord and I though it was a lot of car for the money. However not at the same level of the TL. I actually liked it and would have been a strong possibility. But when I looked at TL, I really thought I was getting more for the money. The newer SE trim is fantastic. I liked the looks and the drive. The leather and seats are top notch. The interior was a step above. The 18 inch tires and wheels were a knockout. the spoiler is super cool. Both the suspension and the driving dynamics are different. So the cars might be very similar in many respects, but the cars are very different. to answer your question, I think I can get the $4500 price difference when the time comes to sell it. If not, hopefully, I will feel that based on what I paid, I got my monies worth.

I know looks are very subjective so what looks good to one my not look good to another. I think the newer version of the TL looks great. THe new Accord would have been a fine choice too, but the small Acura premium was worth it to me."
131,andres3,August 2013,"Absolutely agree with you that there is usually a lot more than meets the eye in the differences between the ""luxury"" version and the ""regular"" version. When people say the A3 is a GTI with a nicer interior I laugh. There were and are real suspension tuning, sound insulation, quality (paint, fit/finish, QC for less issues) that made them far different. And for me the interior was a wide margin apart that the premium was worth it (also longer warranty and free maintenance back in '06).

However, playing devil's advocate, I'd value the Acura's longer warranty over Honda at about $0.01, since you'll be likely to never use either, even if they made it a Korean length warranty. :P

I think the 2013 Accord vs. TL comparison is particularly intriguing this year because the new Accord is so far improved moreso than previously and the TL is unchanged this year. I think it makes the comparison closer than any other. I mean, the extra fuel efficiency of the Honda is a very big deal and margin and you only lose 2 HP to the FWD TL.

Looks are subjective, but if you prefer one over the other, I can see that being worth $1-2K.

Better leather and interior is EASILY worth $1-2K in my book.

I'm sure 18"" wheels are available on the Honda, and I think may just be standard on the V6 EX-L trim that would be comparable. If not I'm sure it's an option.

If the Acura still maintains a superior suspension tuning and handling package then that's worth some dough too, but I've heard Honda has closed that gap.

As to the better name, that's paying for the badge, me personally, woudn't pay more than $0.01 for that. Subjective vs. objective differences.

Back in 2006 I compared the TSX to the Accord and the TSX for sure had a far superior interior and fit & finish. If you can't see it; those buyers should get Chrysler's.

133,mrminsky1,August 2013,"The Extra Year of warranty and the Overall dealer experience is better and worth something. The Acura might not have the cache that Lexus, BMW, or Mercedes might be , but it is still an entry luxury badge with a little extra to boost.
I get the latest TL has not been a hit. I am not going to tell anyone otherwise. I get Honda has made some questionable moves with their designs and general consumer appeal. But I still rather have an Acura badge than a Honda Badge especially when you consider how Acura has been discounted the Tl and how close in price it is the ACCORD. Again, the TL should retail much higher and it isn't so the playing field is not the same. Since I paid closer to $32K rather than closer to the $40K might be I would have considered something else. Maybe!!!!!!!!

As I said before, the new ACCORD is a fair comparison the base TL and you make a strong point. Some people might like the design better and the price better. But again they are not the same cars and when the premium brand can be had a such discount, it becomes a no brainer of a decision."
134,graphicguy,August 2013,"andres3...sounds like you really like the S4. They're great cars. Go for it. I will say that the Audi S/C 3.0 is WAAAAAYY UNDER RATED. My guess is it puts out closer to 350+ instead of the ~330HP they advertise.

I don't have the nappa leather in mine. I have the leather/synth suede stuff. It works...no complaints.

Really find both the Acura and the Audi to be similar in materials and build, inside and out. Paint? I have the Ibis White. No metallic. The only S4 colors I've seen on the lots are my white, a metallic white (extra cost), black, metallic black (extra cost), a mid-level blue (extra cost). Audi interiors are black or grey. Not sure about the TL's colors these days. I know my sister's is metalic black. My former TL was something called ""Bellanova white"" (metallic white). I don't remember paying more for the metallic, but Acura may have changed their tune. Don't know that I can say the paint job on one or the other is better. Leather on my sister's TL is pretty darned nice. Her seats are nicer (comfortable with good bolstering) than the ones in my S4 (hard and highly bolstered). She has full leather, I don't. Shifter in the Audi gets red hot in the summer sun (plastic). TL has a leather shifter....does not get hot. I do like the steering wheel of my S4 better. Plus, the S4's dash and console area is prettier.

The electronics in the TL are much better than those in the S4 (which has been where most of my warranty work been). Some MMI issues my dealer still can't figure out.

Different cars, different routes, different drivers, but I get about 19 MPG overall in my S4. My sister says she gets about 22 MPG overall in her TL SH AWD.

The 3.7 in the TL SH AWD is down on HP compared to the 3.7 in the INfiniti. But, the Acura has more torque than the Infiniti.

I truly do wish my S4 spent less time at the dealer's shop. It is a PITA. But, when it's on the road, it's a true joy to drive.

Then again, so is the TL SH AWD. Bottom line, you can't go wrong with either as long as you go into it with open eyes.

Tough call. Your money. Do what you want. Let us know what you land on.

BTW....my BMW dealer had a ""drive event"" a couple of weeks ago. At the S4's price, I'd throw in the 335i xDrive into the mix. The F30s aren't as good as my previous E92, but they're still good cars. At that $55K price point, you can get a pretty loaded up 335ix. A Premium Plus S4 with B&O and DSG will hit right about the same price range. Plus, I believe BMW dealers are more willing to deal than Audi dealers.

138,tlong,August 2013,"Graphicguy, your experiences mirror my somewhat dated ones.

I bought a new '98 A4 2.8 6cyl, stick, sports package brand new. I drove it 6 years and loved the car. I did start having some reliability issues with cooling and the dealer had trouble locating the problem. I had a number of visits out of warranty and spent $1-2K on the car and it still wasn't fully fixed. Reluctantly at 88K miles (much sooner than I usually get rid of a car) in 2005 I replace the A4 with an '05 Acura TL.

I'm still driving the Acura and I'm at 133K, with almost zero problems. The Acura is technologically superior to the Audi. The interior features are better although I felt the luxury quality of the Audi interior was superior (but the Acura is still quite good). In driving qualities there was no comparison - the Acura is a nice cruiser; the Audi was a fabulous car to drive stick, much more agile, and it was as smooth as butter.

I only wish I could have the Acura levels of reliability in an Audi or other German car. I still like the Acura a lot, but I really miss that Audi. But I don't miss the reliablity issues and dealer costs."

140,andres3,August 2013,"I do like the S4's looks, styling, and engineering. Not too many buttons, I did get button overload in the TL SH-AWD and the center display behind the steering wheel was way too small for my tastes. The Acura just goes nuts with buttons, and comes off as a ""TECHIE"" car to me, whereas the Audi comes off as an Engineer's driver's driver car.

However, $55K is out of my budget. I'm already stretching and blowing the budget if I start at a stripper base model no options S4, which will get close to $55K out the door anyway given CA taxes and DMV fees.

Realistically I'm looking at a 2 year old S4 at about $40K vs. the TL-SH-AWD brand new.

What year is your S4?

The other problem with getting a stripped no options S4 is I would REALLY REALLY Like the Bang & Olufsen sound system upgrade, DSG (no brainer to me), and the rear sport differential. Those are pretty much must haves (OK, the sounds sytem isn't a must, but highly worth the additional cost and you can get it as a stand alone add-on). Also, I wish I could get the Nappa Leather as a stand alone low cost upgrade (as I've pointed out it takes the S4's seat/armrest, door lining interior up to another level and you can also get red, brown, or white mixed into your black bolsters), unfortunately, I think it comes packaged only with the Premium Plus or Prestige packages $$$$.

This is why a 2011 or 2012 S4 could be in my future rather than the one I looked at, which was a fresh off the boat brand spankin' new 2014 model in a beautiful metallic pearl dark grey. Maybe because it was spotless and the TL's typically had been sitting for awhile with 100-200 miles on them it made the paint pop better on the Audi.

That 2014 S4 had all the upgrades, 19"" wheels, nappa, B&O sound, adaptive suspension, bells and whistles $55K sticker. Talk about lust. 19"" wheels are highly unnecessary and expensive though each time you buy tires, but they looked great (tri-spoke design).

It's a shame your S4's been a dud reliability wise, I'd be angry if that happened to me. Hopefully, you were just unlucky and most S4's are reliable.

If I was going to consider BMW (which has a large share of reliability issues lately it seems), it would be the 335i, saw one at Carmax for about $25K with about 37K miles 2009 sport package. No need for AWD on a BMW in So Cal.

I should probably take a look at Infiniti; I liked their interior design on the G35's last I looked. I want to try either RWD or AWD for the next car.

1) Swap cars with your Sister for 2 weeks. She gets the S4 and you get the TL SH AWD.
2) Start with full tanks and use up the whole tank and calculate your gas mileage.

I have a feeling you get less mileage because Audi's beg to be driven while I fear the Acura will just want to be commuted in. The S4 is smaller, lighter, has an additional gear, and a smaller engine. It should get better economy, but never underestimate Honda/Acura on efficiency.

Acura misses: ELS sounds system should be standard in all SH-AWD TL models, as should the better perforated Milano leather. Tech package should have neither of those features inside it, but it does.

Granted, I don't try, in any way, shape or form to save fuel. So, maybe 19 MPG is pretty good, given the way I drive. But, I had an E92 335ix before the Audi. Same driving style, and got 21 MPG. We're not talking a big delta looking at those numbers.

I've never been in a ""base"" TL. So, I don't know how those stack up, technology wise. Without a doubt, for an enthusiast, the SH AWD with Tech Package is the way to go.

My sister has the Advance package. Her leather (Milano?) is very nice.

Mine is a '13, that my (then) GF bought when the '13s had hit the streets last spring. I'm sure the '14s are out by now, but not certain of that. It's a Premium Plus. It has the torque vectoring rear (as does the TL SH AWD), DSG, keyless start. B&O is good. I don't think it trumps the ELS in the Acura, though. Plus, dealer still can't seem to get my iPod/iPhone to work consistently with it.

It was a ~$55K sticker. IIRC, purchase price was right around $52K and change....give or take.

Still waiting for the part from Germany to get the ""Quattro binding"" issue fixed. Dealer says it's not hurting anything by driving it. Sometimes I wonder, given how it shudders.

They put me in nice cars to drive while it's in the shop. Do I still like it?

Yeah....it's a great car to drive. Is it worth the $12K-$15K premium over the TL SH AWD Tech? I can't make that case. The Acura is really good, too.

Will I buy another one? Probably not. I'll hold onto this one for another 18-24 mos. That will take it to near the end of the warranty period. Based on current experiences, I don't want to own it after the warranty has expired.

Engines aren't even in the same ball park. Basically, the TL wins on features and tech, the S4 on drive-train.

Prices are not in the same ball park either.

You can feel the lighter weight of the S4, thanks in large part due to it being a bit smaller.

The ELS system blows the B&O system out of the water. However, I heard a DVD-A in the ELS sound system and satellite radio on the B & O (not in the same ball park for source quality).

159,graphicguy,August 2013,"andres....I can't quarrel with any of your assessments. Pretty much the same feelings I have.

The only differing opinion, as mentioned, I helped my sister buy a TL. She also looked at the re-done Accord. Personally, I could tell where the extra money went for the TL...suspension, steering (found both a bit too light for my tastes), upgraded materials in the TL, sound system, etc. But, as you say, for $25K you'd be hard pressed to find a better car.

The S4 is more ""hard edged"" than the TL. As you say, it's lighter, smaller, more tossable. It's also faster. The S/C 3.0 is so sweet, and even faster than the previous S4 V8. But, the price for that isn't insignificant.

If I hadn't had so many issues with the MMI/B&O I might feel different. But, the TL's Nav/ELS trumps the S4's B&O. Seats are nicer in the TL, too....better leather.

I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on the new IS350. I came close to buying one a few years ago. It was a little luxo rocket at the time. I just couldn't get either of the two Lexi dealers (owned by the same guy) to really get to what I thought was a fair price. We did get within about $500, but then they acted like they were insulted that I wanted to get less than MSRP.

I think those same dealers are readily taking less than MSRP, now. The lack of product from Japan's tsunami and all the bad press over their cars inability to stop a few years ago I think really hurt their business....at least locally.

161,markcincinnati,August 2013,"Our 2011 FX35 is coming off lease -- and Infiniti has already tried to lure my wife into another Infiniti with an ""early out"" or ""pull ahead"" deal (you know where at least 3 months of the lease is forgiven, plus any miles over are wiped off the books.) In the time frame where we switched from German to Japanese, the primary motivation was the super sub-vented lease deals offered by (at the time) Acura and Infiniti. We've actually grown to have more than a modest amount of appreciation for the Infiniti and, truth be told, my '12 SH-AWD TL Advance Acura has certainly made me confident that its reputation for durability is probably well deserved.

The issue -- of course there is an issue -- is that theses otherwise fine cars still fall short of the driving pleasure of the German cars that have dominated our garage since 1977.

We've driven, recently:

Audi A4 2.0T '14 MY
Audi A6 2.0T quattro '14 MY
Audi Q5 (both 2.0T and 3.0T) '13 & '14 MY
BMW X3 (with the turbo four) '13 MY
Infiniti FX37 '13 MY
Infiniti Q50XS '14 MY
Volvo XC60 T6

I'll jump to the most important points (in my mind):

The Q5 3.0T can be very nicely configured for a hair under $50K -- and compared to the S4 vs the A4, feels like a bargain.

The BMW nicely configured is breathtakingly expensive from an MSRP standpoint, perhaps there is a super sub-vented lease deal on it, though.

The Audi A6 2.0T Premium Plus with Sport Package costs about the same as a NOT fully equipped Infiniti Q50 AWD -- but the A6 isn't nearly as quick. The A6, however, feels like a very good deal (the 2014 has a slight HP bump).

I'd hold off on the A4 until the new one comes here next year -- it seems just like my 2009 A4 Prestige Sport -- not that that is a bad thing, but it seems more dated, somehow.

The Volvo is very nice, but mostly because in T6 form it is very peppy. The deals and lease programs on the Volvos make them probably the most expensive -- which is to say they cost too much.

The Infiniti Q50S AWD is slightly NORTH of $50K -- and that is without vented seats and without blind spot monitoring. The car is super nice -- but it feels small inside and although the interior is a huge leap forward over the outgoing G, $50K is too much for what you get. If you're looking for performance -- it seems to have it, but the engine in the Q5 3.0T is, about a million percent smooooother.

Already the Q50 is being offered in AWD trim for $399 per month on a super lease deal (at least here in Cincinnati) -- so maybe the breathtaking price of the Q50 at MSRP should be taken with a grain of salt.

Too bad you cant get an A4 with the Q5 supercharged engine in it (and not have to pay the premium to jump into an S4.)

Bottom line -- it is a great time to be in the market for a new car. However, there may need to be a reality adjustment for Infiniti -- for as nice as it is, we still can't call the BMW the German Infiniti, we still, however, call the Infiniti the Japanese BMW.

Based on the driving of these cars (and yes, I do know there are three CUV's in the above list), the Q50 and the Q5 are the most rewarding -- both in performance and luxury. The A6, if you're looking for a ""bargain basement"" sport luxury vehicle is also worthy of your consideration (they must have done something to make the A6 2.0T feel THAT strong!)

The next few shopping months are gonna be fun!

163,markcincinnati,August 2013,"Here is one aspect of the bundling of features and options the automakers seem hell bent to force onto us: the nearly autonomous capabilities some of the technology seems to imbue these cars with comes at a huge cost ($ cost.)

I have now had blind spot monitoring for nearly 6 years -- and as much as I am against the government telling us what we HAVE to have, must pay for, etc, I am literally dumbfounded that BSW isn't as standard as turn signals, brake lights and seat belts. Infiniti, for instance, offers BSW as part of a package of technologies that literally makes the Q50 damn near capable of driving itself -- and the charge is over $3,000. Audi and Volvo charge $500 to $700 -- which has to be about 90% margin.

My point is, why not offer an unbundled price list -- I don't want all the autonomous driving stuff (at this point) that you are forced to buy if you want the perfectly reasonable and proven BSW technology.

On the other hand, if you really do want all of the mitigating technologies offered, I would understand a bundling discount.

For years, it used to be you had to order a truckload of options just to get a heated steering wheel -- or you had to get leather seats if you wanted rear seat heaters.

If there is a technology reason to bundle some feature set, I'm OK with that -- but at this point, the current generation of autonomous technologies offered are just not likely to be used by either my wife or me -- but we want BSW, just like we want turn signals, ESP, seatbelts and so forth.

Additionally, so many of the new EXPENSIVE options offered seem to be computer processor, software or chip based -- meaning super high gross margins. Why make me buy lane keeping technology and automatic cruise control when what I would find far more useful is BSW.

Assuming I can justify a $50K Infiniti Q50 when a much nicer A6 quattro sport is about $1,000 more (and that includes BSW) why ding me for yet another $3K when all I want is a fairly priced (~$600) technology that has saved me tens of thousands of dollars as it warned me my blind spot was full of a big ol vehicle just waiting for me to have a stupid attack?"
164,sweendogy,August 2013,"Seems like a long post for one option- my opinion which means zero - you can get a 50k q50 with bsw - I'm sure at that price point one would get a boatload more car then an 51k A6 with BSW. (Again I've not done the apples to apples research)

This BSW must be something for one to go off on such an item- one would also argue the bSW and other options on that package are options that most people would not want- I like options packaging as long as the lower options (sunroof and nav) get priced at the lower end of the packaging range and not forced on you with other packages like BSM and lane departure - things I can live without. I think the Japanese have made options packaging a thing because it cuts down on costs. German cars can be ordered ala cart which is cool -

Drive fast, take chances - sween"
165,markcincinnati,August 2013,"Yes, a long post if the entire spirit of what I was ""on about"" was a single feature -- my peeve is with the concept of being able to choose to select a set of features or to customize.

I read an article about the concept of the ""option-less"" vehicle. In short, since most of the options are software or firmware based, it is actually more efficient to build every option possible into every car and charge those who want it.

Our IBM computer, for instance, has a capability called ""computing on demand"" essentially the computer is delivered with the biggest baddest CPU made -- but it is hobbled at 60% 70% 80% etc capacity unless you're willing to pay for the extra horsepower. Some companies pay for 2 days of full horsepower once per month for the monthly demanding processing routines.

My last Audi -- with the assistance of a free software program and a $300 cable, was able to have any number of features enabled or disabled via a laptop. Companies -- both factory approved and not approved -- offer performance upgrades via a reprogramming of the vehicles on-board brain. Volvo even offers a PoleStar upgrade to its turbo engines -- for a price.

Point is, we've been at a time and place in technology where our cars are largely controlled by software, so putting in every possible feature or option into every car and charging those folks like my wife and me to turn features on and off, would be a revenue (and income) enhancer.

Mass customization has been possible for some time -- and it would be a money maker. Bundling just pisses people off or puts them off spending.

On the other hand, BSW is one of those things that once you have it, you can't imagine how you ever lived without it."
166,sweendogy,August 2013,"I hear what you are saying and it makes sense about the full packaged car with expandable options, even after you leave the lot. (Would like to see the software program that includes wheel and tire, sunroof, seats, suspension and other items thou). The car makers will learn a lot about what tesla is doing with its customizable options and production line efficiency. Bsw seems like a good idea to be standard - but I wouldn't use it."
167,markcincinnati,August 2013,"At the risk of raising the ire of the moderator, I am wondering, not critically, why you wouldn't use BSW? To underscore the point, I would assume you don't stick your arm out the window to indicate you are turning -- you flick the turn signal stalk, yes?

My first experience with BSW was accidental -- I ordered a new Audi A4 in 2008 with what was then the just announced Prestige package. BSW came standard (as did a backup camera).

I, initially, thought, how lame -- backup cameras are for mini-vans, real ""men"" (or women) don't need no stinkin' backup camera. As I recall, the default for BSW was to come on when you started the car (like ESP, ABS, and ""auto"" for the Audi Drive Select system) -- then, you could punch a button to turn it off.

After a few times of ""forgetting"" to turn it off, I noticed that little amber stack of LED's (in the outboard mirror housing) come on when there was no one or nothing around -- you know, I checked my mirrors. Well shut the front door -- multiple times over the initial few months of having this ""excuse to charge more"" feature (that I didn't even order), I would see the light come on, see nothing in any of my mirrors and ""just for the heck of it"" I would look over my shoulder, and damn if there wasn't someone in my blind spot.

In short, I came to not only appreciate BSW, I started to count the number of times the lights came on that I would have sworn no one was near me -- just one time of ignoring those lights (or, god forbid, not having them) would have been at least a 4-figure episode at a body shop (or worse, especially if it had been on the freeway.)

What I am saying is that I was (past tense) in the same place you're in when my new 2009 A4 came in in October 2008 equipped with this ""who needs it"" piece of tech. Further I am suggesting that as perhaps stupid and simple as it may seem, it is right up there with such things as sealed beam headlights, turn signals, brake lights, backup cameras and holes in the roof.

What once were vices (?) are now necessities.

Finally, don't discount it until you've had it for a few months and find out that it has both a positive financial and safety feature.

I've never had a vehicle that had a blind spot if my mirrors were adjusted correctly. Just google adjusting mirrors and you'll find advice. Keeping my head almost absolutely straight ahead I can glance in my side mirrors and see both adjacent lanes if I'm driving in the middle lane of a three lane. The rear view is for for that....rear view. When a car leaves my vision in my rear view mirror the front grill of the vehicle appears in my side mirror. When I actually am going to change lanes I lean and turn my head and look in my side mirror and make sure I am missing nothing but I never have to turn my head and look over my shoulder. Never had a close call when I checked....only those very infrequent times when I might have been a little agitated and started to make a quick lane change did I even come close to a problem. Been driving over 40 years and never had an accident involving changing lanes and not seeing someone. This was taught in driver's training I took during high school and I probably really got used to adjusting my mirrors correctly driving a truck and having to use just the side mirrors to back up with.

If you are driving looking straight ahead and glance to your side mirrors and can see any part of your vehicle, then your mirrors isn't adjusted right. You don't want to see your vehicle....you want to see the lane next to you.

Traveling all over the US and being in cities that I'm not familiar with, trying to navigate freeways, toll roads and highways, listening to the GPS at times can be daunting to say the least. I like the BSW feature, I just had two 2014 Chevy Impala's ( In Chitown and San Fran) with this feature, and I liked it. I arrived in Chicago during rush hour traffic (thanks to ATC delay) and it was a nightmare.

When people are traveling the same route everyday to work or the store or in laws house, one really doesn't need the BSW, but when you unfamiliar cities BSW is very helpful."

178,igozoomzoom,August 2013,"When I bought my 2012 Mazda CX-9 last year, the only trim level I considered was the top-level Grand Touring. The 20"" wheels and chrome door handles totally change the look compared to the lesser models (and their 18"" wheels are hideous and look cheap). It also had Mazda's BSM (Blind Spot Monitoring) system standard, but the very concept seemed ridiculous to me. I expected to deactivate it and never give it another thought.

I've always believed that blind spots could be eliminated with properly adjusted mirrors, which was true based on all the cars I've owned in the past. But the CX-9 is a much larger vehicle that it looks, being classified as a Full-Size or Large Crossover/CUV. Even now, it simply doesn't look that big to me and it feels more like a sporty mid-size sedan behind the wheel than any other SUV I've ever driven.

Even with my mirrors perfectly adjusted (which so few drivers ever learn to do), there is a blind spot on both sides at the rear corners! I'm not sure exactly how other systems work, but on the Mazda there are cameras mounted under the rear bumper at both corners. When a vehicle enters the space that a camera is monitoring, a yellow warning light (little picture of one car driving into the side of another with a big X over it) appears on the side mirror on that side of the car. If the turn signal is activated indicating a lane change and a vehicle is in the 'blind spot', the audio system mutes and a series of warning beeps alerts the driver.

It actually works very well, although I still think a quick half-turn of the head to use my peripheral vision to make sure the lane is clear is important! Mazda has expanded the functionality of the system in some 2014 models to include Rear Cross Traffic Alert. RCTA uses the same cameras as BSM to scan for vehicles moving toward you as you back out of a parking space.

I am a very alert and focused driver. Instead of focusing on the car in front of me, I am always scanning further ahead so I can be ready to brake, maneuver or accelerate instantly if I need to. Even when I have no need to change lanes, I love the fact that I always know if a vehicle is flanking me on either side. For example, you're driving on a 3-lane expressway and suddenly a delivery truck drops a refrigerator right into yoru lane and you have barely a second to react. Knowing which side of your car was clear for your to swerve into that lane could be life-saving information!

While I find BSM to be useful, some of the latest 'safety' features available are over-the-top and seem like addded complexity just so they can add more acronyms to the car's features! The new 2014 Mazda6 has a Forward Obstruction Warning System that ""detects obstructions ahead and warns you of a possible collision."" My car already has this- it's called a windshield, you look through it and if you see something in your path, you press the brake and/or steer around it.

There's also Mazda's Radar Cruise Control that monitors the distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you and adjusts speed up to a driver-set limit or down to maintain a safe following distance. Um, if I'm using cruise control then I'm on an interstae with two or more lanes. If a car ahead of me slows down, I don't want to slow down with them, I will go around them!

My mom was shopping for a new car earlier this year and the Acura TSX, Nissan Maxima and Volvo S60 were on her short list. We went to the Volvo dealer near my house and started walking the lot so she could see some different inteiror colors, available wheel designs and other features that can be difficult to decipher by looking at a brochure.

I have a rather dark sense of humor at times and I consider sarcasm (or smart@ss as my nana called it) my second language. My mom has a great sense of humor but she's a lot nicer than me (most of the time) and never rude or sarcastic, but every now and then she'll fire back a retort to a comment I make that surprises the heck out of me (and proves that I've been a bad influence on my own mom, which makes me very proud)!

While we were walking around checking out the S60 models they had in stock, we were greeted by a saleman who barely looked old enough to drive a car, much less sell them. He was obviously very green and instead of screwing with the kid's head, I actually decided to be nice. He started going over the cars features and one of the first topics was-

Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection

The Full Auto Brake with Pedestrian Detection was the world's first and he went into great detail. He explained that it was active at speeds up to approximately 25mph and, if it detected a pedestrian ahead, it would alert the driver if there was enough time to apply the brakes, or it would automatically cut the throttle and apply full braking force automatically if necessary!

I couldn't resist and asked, ""But what if i WANT to hit someone in the road ahead?""

Before he could speak, my mom replied instantly- ""Well you'd just need to be going over 25mph. Under 25mph you'd barely maim them, at best...""

**I have never been more proud of my Mom in all of my 39 years!

The poor salesman (sales-boy, sales-child?) had a look on his face that I can't convey in words...he excused himself less than a minute later and the Sales Manager came back in his place and we never saw the kid again.....And I was ready to start asking about trunk space and how many cubic feet of space does an average human body occupy...

Once we realized that the Sales Manager was completely devoid of any sort of perosnality, we were bored and decided to move on to another Volvo dealer for the test drive. We both behaved very well right up to the end...when I decided to test the Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake by driving at constant 20mph directly toward the wall of the service department. It worked...but apparently the salesman with us felt that I should have warned him before I did it!? Did I need to tell him before I turned on the stereo, or clicked on the turn signal??? If I'm going to buy a car (or my mom), of course I'm going to test out every feature it has....duh!

There are only three Volvo dealers in Metro Atlanta and we decided not to visit the third one sinice we probably won't be welcomed with open arms at the other two!

She ended up falling in love with a CPO 2010 Infiniti M35 Sport with 21k miles on it. My step-dad insisted on going with us to buy it so he could act as a buffer between us...we were on our best behavior...I almost died of boredom. But the car rocks!

179,andres3,August 2013,"Excellent drivers check their blind spot, every time, no exceptions.

Of course, if you don't check your blind spot, and the system didn't warn you (essentially it fails), how do you prove it, who do you blame, and do they take the liability of payments for damage?

I seriously doubt it, I'd look every time even with the blinking side mirror. If it proved itself faultless after 5 years and millions of lane changes, perhaps I'd ease up on it.

180,andres3,August 2013,"Lexus IS 350 report.

I drove the regular RWD IS350 and the F-Sport IS 350 (RWD too).

Some Background:
Several years ago I drove an IS 350 and it had a tremendous engine, it felt very fast and had it all over the TL-S even though the numbers were close, the speed wasn't, Lexus won easy. That is why I gave the new IS350 some consideration.

While a very nice, comfortable, quiet sports sedan, it just feels devoid of soul, with no personality other than being modern and techie.

I am feeling nearly 100% positive the 8-speed automatic must be programmed to allow only 70% engine power during the first 1,000 miles (for proper break-in) even during full throttle acceleration, because I felt the car was slow and sluggish, and not giving me the 305 HP I wanted to feel. I am spoiled by a dual clutch auto, but dang it, I wanted to like the car, but I just didn't.

Superb leather, drive, ride, handled pretty good, well put together, but it just didn't feel like a $45K car. 100% made in Japan; that was impressive.

There just wasn't all that much difference between regular comfort mode, and sport mode, nor from sport mode, to sport + (only in F-sport trim). I felt the '11 S4 had much more noticeable difference between comfort and dynamic (more legit and mechanical; less electronic feeling).

A Lexus dealer quoted me sticker MSRP on one; is it 2002 again? What's the point of online quotes if you just reiterate the sticker price?

While seemingly significantly sportier than previous Lexus attempts, it still comes off as a softer quieter car.

ATS test drive: Some of the same feelings, though the 3.6 is much more refined and has more punch than the 2.0T. The interior doesn't do it for me in the ATS though. There are a few interior parts and pieces that you can tell belong on a 10K car, not a 50K car (moon/sun roof cover is one). The 2.0T felt like 200 HP since that's what my Audi had stock with its 2.0T. Maybe Audi underrates, Cadillac overrates, and there you go. The ATS was a good handler though, but didn't feel fun. The 3.6 was more fun, and sounded better under hard acceleration. Changing from TOUR to Sport mode didn't do much.

The ATS chassis and suspension was upset and unbalanced by minor imperfections in the roadway. A 1"" deep 1' diamter circle in the asphalt would be run over in my Audi and ignored, but in the ATS, it felt like the back end came out and I wasn't going fast, nor accelerating hard at the time. Happened with both ATS' trying both engines.

181,jeffm5,August 2013,"Interesting discussion about safety nannies. I bought a Volvo S60 last year with the tech package. The only one I find annoying is the lane departure warning, so I have it turned off.

I think each driver is responsible for the safe operation of his or her own car. Technology can fail. I like blind spot warning, but I still visually check the blind spot before changing lanes. On the other hand, I'm not perfect. The eyes and reflexes aren't what they used to be. So, if technology can give me a ""heads-up"", I'll take it.

Love the S60, BTW."
182,graphicguy,August 2013,"Andres...thanks for the update. You and I seem to have the same perceptions.

While I haven't driven the '14 IS 350, and I doubt it's on my radar anytime in the foreseeable future, it's good to hear initial impressions.

I did test drive an ATS. The 2.0L is coarse, to say the least, and certainly not remotely as smooth as the Audi 2.0 turbo. The 3.6L is smoother, but I'm not so certain it performs any better than the 6 cyl. Like you, I found some of the interior materials to be ""Chevy Cruze"" looking.

It did handle well, but also as you point out, the suspension crashes a lot over the slightest road imperfections to achieve most of its handling abilities (that, and some impressive weight trimming).

Again, to me it didn't feel like a mid $40K car.

Markincincinnati, I was wondering how the 2.0L in something as big as the A6 would work. So, you're saying it isn't sluggish?

I like the Q5. And, a Q5 with the S/C 3.0L would be the first vehicle I'd be looking at IF (BIG IF) I were ever in the market for an SUV.

BTW, the S4 is over in Beechmont (already tried Montgomery twice) for the 3rd attempt to fix the Quattro ""binding"" issues, and iPod issue resolved. They put me in another A6 3.0 for the weekend. Man...is it nice, fast and handles well for a big car. That said, it's also much ""softer"" all the way around coming from the S4.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
183,markcincinnati,August 2013,"Although I had previously seen the ""Car & Driver"" set up of the three mirrors that adorn modern autos, I did a double check last night after work as I made myself and the car ready for my 20 mile commute home (up I71 North from downtown Cincinnati). The set up of the mirrors and the driver's posture and seat position are very important to reducing (but as I came to find out, NOT eliminating) the blind spot. My 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD advance comes with BSW. I assume it is a radar like system, rather than a camera system.

Sitting up straight, hands at 9 and 3, not slouching, etc, I began the drive up I71. I was in the center of 3 lanes. In my three mirrors, I could -- so I thought -- see cars coming up on the right, center and left and I could see the perfect transition of the image from one mirror to the next.

It is indeed critical that the outside mirrors do NOT show you a view of the side of your car -- the key is to set them exactly at the point where you just lose sight of the side of your car.

OK, so I am thinking, ""with my mirrors, seat and posture all perfect, I probably don't need BSW."" The thing is, I look around and more than 50% of the drivers clearly appear to be slouching and/or talking on the phone, fiddling with the phone's key pad or, with a cool day like yesterday, driving with their windows down and their left elbow hanging out.

So I think I am in the safe zone blind spot wise. Less than one mile up the freeway, my left BSW comes on and stays on. I am looking in all three mirrors and I see nothing. The thing is, there was a car one lane to the left hanging at a geo synchronous position just out of the view range of the left outside mirror. I know this because after the light stayed on for more than 5 seconds, I took my foot off of the accelerator and almost immediately the car ""hanging"" out on my left rear became visible. Without the light, had I attempted to change lanes (to the left), I assume I would have either heard a horn honk or, worst case, been clipped (or perhaps I would better describe it as I would have been the clipper and the guy in my blind spot the clippee.)

Nothing anyone could have said to me, back in 2008 would have made me spend money to buy BSW -- it just came along with all of the other things I wanted on the Prestige trim level. But it is a great technology.

Perhaps there is something that someone here could say to persuade the doubters to make certain they at least gave BSW a chance to prove its merits. I have no idea, however, what those words would be.

Suffice it to say that it is very possible to greatly reduce the value of this technology by properly setting your mirrors, steering wheel and seat position. However, I can only assume that it is the MINORITY of folks who actually do this.

Therefore, however, notwithstanding: this technology is (relatively) cheap (except when Infiniti makes customers spend $3,200 to get BSW in a package that contains a bunch of technology that seems overpriced and perhaps not ready for prime time insofar as most drivers are concerned) and it works -- typically better than we humans are able to do every time.

I can remember when I got a car -- in 1985 -- with ABS, I also remember 13 years ago getting a car with ESP. ABS and ESP were, for over a decade, available as options, primarily on expensive German cars. Now most cars come with ABS and many come with some form of vehicle stability software (ESP). Way back when (mid 1980's) these technologies came on Audis, they actually had a button on the dash to turn them off -- and I can remember reading letters to the editor in car magazines decrying these electronic nannies. Now, however, we recognize that the computer can pump the brakes 18 times a second -- but that we mere mortals are lucky to get two pumps in a second. We also appreciate the ""miracle"" of ESP in its ability to apply the brakes to one or several wheels at a time to reduce or eliminate spinouts and other out of control automotive behaviors.

The list of technologies that I rejected, in multiple letter acronym form, would fill up the page -- now I expect them and appreciate how they keep me out of many dangerous and/or expensive situations, situations that seem to grow in frequency as our highways become ever more crowded and our drivers ever more unprepared to drive defensively.

In any case, I'll sign off of this topic and hope that you will seriously consider testing or taking a trial term with blind spot warning technology.

I predict BSW will be made ""standard"" equipment in the not too distant future -- assuming it can be turned off, perhaps that is the best possible outcome for folks like me as well as the doubters among us.

Drive it like you live."
184,sweendogy,August 2013,S60 would love to hear more about your experience with the car- don't see too many of them
185,jeffm5,August 2013,"Sween,
I posted my impressions of my S60 about a year ago. (BTW, this is the FWD S60 T5.) It's number 14708 on this thread and was posted 8/14/12. The only thing I can add to that is when accelerating hard from a dead stop there is slight ""turbo lag"". Acceleration from say 55 to 80 is immediate and effortless. The only nagging problem I have is that sometimes the seat memory won't hold the position it has been set for. I had a minor interior trim issue that the dealer took care of. I'm getting better gas mileage now than I was when I wrote the review. I still very much enjoy driving this car, which now is just shy of 12,000 miles.

This is my first vehicle in this class, so I have no idea how it compares to say an ATS or 3 series, outside of it being more affordable. I love the looks of the ATS, but to equip it the way I wanted was not in the budget.

Anyhow, if someone is in the market for this class of car, I'd recommend that they take one out for a spin. I'd be interested in hearing from someone who crossed shopped the S60 to find out their impressions.

Hey, I just noticed that just after my original post, you thanked me for the info. You're welcome. You asked why not another Avalon. My wife and I were anxiously awaiting the 2013 Avy, but when we saw that front grill, our hearts sank. It's a great looking car inside and out, except for that, in our opinion.

It isn't a fast car, but it felt quick. Confident power for merging onto freeways and passing at speed. Handling was very nice too - smooth and refined and I didn't really sense any vagueness in the steering (very tight and responsive, but road feel is non-existent). It felt more nimble than other recent 3ers I've driven. Cornering was surprising flat and tenacious at 8/10ths.

Overall I think it's without a doubt the nicest Buick I've ever driven. Not outstanding, but very competant. If someone gifted it to me, I'd keep it."

188,igozoomzoom,August 2013,"I actually had one last year as a rental when I was in Toronto for two weeks. I always reserve a 'Premium' class vehicle since I travel for 2-3 days per week at least 36 weeks each year. I'm a Commerical Insurance Premium Auditor and the audit expense is billed to the client as part of the contract. Part of my contract with the Audit Firm I work for is that I only stay in at Hilton properties (Hampton or Hilton Garden Inn if possible), I fly busines class and whether I'm driving from home to the client of flying somewhere and renting a car, I can rent anthing I choose as long as it is within $25/day of what I would get for mileage reimbursement in my own car. In reality, I get the Premium cars for a lot less than what I'm allowed!

Anyway, I spent two weeks in Toronto last March and my Premium-class rental car was a 2013 BMW 320i. I've had a 328i here in the U.S. a few times also and, to be honest, the Candian 320i and U.S. 328i look, feel and drive identical 95% of the time. The only time I perceived any difference was under full-throttle accelration, particularly in passing/merging situations more so than from a stop.

Last month, I had to visit a client located about 75 miles west of Los Angelese in the middle of godforsaken nowhere! When I got to Southern California, I prefer to flying to Orange County and drive another 20-30 miles than deal with LAX! I coudn't get a flight into Orange this time, but if I was willing to deal with a plane change in Phoenix that added almost two hours to my trip time, I could fly into Bob Hope instead of LAX. I decided it was worth it because flying into Bob Hope is like flying into Key West, it's so small and everything is so easy and fast.

I was pleasantly surprised that, for the very first time, I had a rental BMW that wasn&#146;t White! This one was a gorgeous deep blue that I later found out is called Imperial Blue Metallic. The reason the rentals are usually White is because any color other than Alpine White or Jet Black is Metallic and costs $550 extra. I was hoping that the $550 paint option might mean it was a heavily optioned model for once.

When I was handed the key fob, I realized that it didn&#146;t appear to have the Comfort Access keyless entry, so that dashed any hopes of it having the Premium Package. I opened the door and the Venetian Beige SensaTec (Leatherette) was a pleasant change from the usual Black faux-leather. After I loaded the trunk and got in the driver&#146;s seat, I started reaching to adjust my seat only find the power seat controls had been moved..and then I finally realized that the seats were 6-way manually adjustable, just like my 2006 Mazda3.and manual driver&#146;s seat didn&#146;t have adjustable lumbar support! I had never. Even my 8yr old Mazda has lumbar support!

I have been spoiled by most other rental cars and by my 2012 Mazda CX-9 because I hadn&#146;t dealt with manually adjusting a seat trying to find the best position in years! No one else ever drives the old Mazda3, so the manual seat never moves.

I&#146;ll give BMW a little credit for seat design and comfort, because even without the lumbar adjustment or any power adjustments, it was still a comfy driver&#146;s seat. Thankfully it wasn&#146;t a COLD driver&#146;s seat because it also lacked heated front seats, which the previous 3-seriees I&#146;ve driven included.

I found the Window Sticker folded up in the glovebox after I got to my hotel that night. This was the most strangely optioned vehicle I&#146;ve ran across in years. I knew something was different about the interior but couldn&#146;t put my finger on it. Then I saw on the Window Sticker that the Dark Burl Walnut Wood trim on the dash was $500 and it replaced the target. I assumed it that the Dark Walnut was part of the Venetian Beige interior color, but that wasn&#146;t the case.

The car had a Power Moonroof which I assumed had become standard on the 3-series until I that Window Sticker. The car still had one oddball feature for me to discover...

Even though it didn&#146;t have the Cold Weather Pkg (Heated seats, alarm system) or the Premium Package (dual power seats, moonroof, Comfort Access key) ; it had the $900 Lighting Package with the Xenon headlight and Adaptive Light Control!

Here&#146;s a recap=

$32,550 &#150; Base MSPR
550 &#150; Imperial Blue Metallic paint
1050 &#150; Moonroof
500 &#150; Dark Burl Walnut wood trim
900 &#150; Lighting Package (Xenon light and Adaptive Light Control
925 &#150; Destination Change

$36,475 was the Grand Total.

I love the color combination with the deep Imperial Blue outside and Venetian Beige interior; the Silver Matte trim that looks good with the Black interior is also standard with the Beige, but I the darker wood trim looks so much better. So the overall appearance and coordination of exterior color with interior color and interior trim was very appealing.

The lack of Power Front Seats is unacceptable on a car that sticker over $36k! Dual power front seats with driver&#146;s seat memory are optional for $995 and would be much more useful than the Xenon headlights.

The BMW 320i reminds me of another car that I often rented back in 2011-2012- the Infiniti G25. The G25 was identical to the G37 Sedan in appearance and standard features. The only difference was the G25 has a 2.5L 218hp V6 in place of the G37&#146;s 3.7L 328hp V6. The G25 smaller, less powerful engine had the unexpected benefit of being smoother and quieter than the G37&#146;s big V6. The G25 was also a pleasure to drive, handled very well and even with 110hp less than G37, it never felt underpowered or like it was missing anything. At least until you got behind the wheel of the G37 and learned what the phrase &#145;stupid-fast&#146; means! After driving the G37, the G25 wasn&#146;t quite as appealing.
Evaluated on its own merits rather than comparing it to other 3-Series models, it is a surprisingly fun car to drive and feels 100% BMW. But after driving the 328i, comparisons are inevitable and the small price difference may not seem like such a deal???

After driving the 320i and even the 328i in the past, the car I rent most often remains my favorite among entry-level luxury sedans- the Volvo S60 T5!

189,dino001,August 2013,"All BMWs are optioned way requested by the sales managers or customers, within model allotments, of course. My guess for the reason of the oddball combination is that the dealer had some rigid price target in mind and grabbed options that fit that without really thinking if they made sense. Perhaps that was also a reason the car landed in the rental lot, as they couldn't sell it retail.

190,fedlawman,August 2013,"I haven't seen one on the road yet either. The white one I drove (with manual seat that I thought was just fine) was at the BMW Drive Event I participated in. The event was poorly run so I only had time for the one drive, but the free BMW travel mug was a nice bit of swag.

I still haven't driven the 328i so I have no basis to compare, but based on my drive, I think most people will be perfectly happy with the power of the 320i. It felt lively to me, and was the most BMW-like BMW I have driven in a long time - meaning, it had a fun, playful, lively, zippiness about it, with ideal ride/handling compliance and enough power to be fun without being scary (like my friend's 2010 M5 I drove a couple weeks ago!)."
191,igozoomzoom,August 2013,"Back in November 2005, I was shopping for new 2005 or 2006 Mazda 3 s 5-door. It was introduced in 2004 and still a very hot seller when I started looking at them. I wanted it in Gray or Silver, 5-speed manual, Power Moonroof AND without Black Leather interior. In 2004 and 2005, Mazda didn&#146;t use trim levels (Sport, Touring, Grand Touring} so there was just a 2005 Mazda s 5-door with five major option packages- ABS/SAB (ABS & side airbags), Moonroof/6CD (self-explanatory), Xenon/TPMS (Xenon HID headlights & Tire Pressure Monitoring), Leather Package (Black was the only choice) and Navigation Package.

All of the packages except Navigation were available in any combination with no pre-requirements that one could only be selected if another specific one was also selected. The exception was that Navigation required the ABS/SAB and Moonroof/6CD Package.

Initially, I was surprised to find any new 2005 models left in 11/2005 and, the few that were still available were discounted heavily considering that getting $1000 of sticker on a 2006 was considered a steal! But then I realized that most of them had very odd option combinations. I found a 2005 s 5-door in Titanium Gray with Black/Red cloth interior, 5-MT, Moonroof/6CD (exactly what I wanted so far) and it also had the Xenon/TPMS Package which was fine since it was discounted almost $3k off MSRP. I finally realized the problem- it didn&#146;t have the ABS/SAB Package! No ABS was a deal-breaker at any price!

Mazda also introduced a special edition a few months into the 2005 model year called the &#145;sp23&#146;. It was based on the s 4-door or 5-door and it added a new Bose audio system, Leather interior, heated front seats for the first time, Rain-sensing wipers and several other upscale features. It was only available in one color called Carbon Grey but it could have Black or Saddle Leather interior. I found a sp23 5-door, 5-MT with the Saddle interior advertised for $1500 off MSRP which was a great deal since most of these went for full sticker. The only options available were a Power Moonroof and a Safety/Security Package that included the ABS/SAB & Xenon/TPMS Packages from the regular s 5-door plus an alarm system and it was $1600. I seriously thought I had found the perfect one, especially with the gorgeous Saddle Leather (the only reason I didn&#146;t want leather was because Black was the only choice until the sp23 and the Saddle option was only one this special 2005 model. My best friend and I drove six hours from Atlatna to Mobile, AL planning to buy it and bring it back home with me! When I got there, I realized that it didn&#146;t have the Safety/Security Package, so it didn&#146;t have ABS, Side Airbags, Xenon headlights or Tire Pressure Monitor!!! It had Bose, Moonroof, Heated (Saddle) Leather, Rain-sensing freakin&#146; wipers BUT not Anti-lock Brakes.I almost cried until I realized how stupid it was that Mazda allowed the car to be configured in such a way.

For 2006, ABS was made standard across the board and the Sport, Touring and Grand Touring trim levels were introduced. The Touring added front door-mounted side-impact & front and rear curtain airbags standard. The s Sport 5-door didn&#146;t offer any options other than the 5AT. To get the Moonroof/6CD option, I had to go with the Touring (which I would anyway for the side airbags) and Leather was optional on the Touring (still Black and still not heated) but anyone who wanted leather went with the top-level Grand Touring which included most of the sp23 features (Bose, heated leather,Xenon). It made locating a car with the features you wanted a lot easier. But nothing is ever really easy for me! When I finally figured out that I wanted a 2006 Madza3 s 5-door Touring, Titanium Gray with Black/Red checkered cloth, 5-speed manual with the Moonroof/6CE Package, there were just two exact matches within a 300-mile radius of Atlanta. One was in metro Atlanta and the other was in Knoxville, TN. I went to the Atlanta dealership on a Wednesday the week before Christmas 2005, relieved that I would finally have my car. Instead I had the single worst experience of my life (not worst car buying or dealership experience, not the worst experience as a consume- it literally the worst day of my entire 31 years and still holds that distinction now that I&#146;m 39)! I won&#146;t even start talking about it because I start shaking from rage as I even think about it. But I was so angry that I smoked all four tires in my mom&#146;s Grand Cherokee as I backed out of my parking space and it didn&#146;t faze me a bit when I almost clipped the Sales Manager in the parking lot AND I backed out with my the gas to the floor and didn&#146;t manage to stop going in reverse before I backed thru one of the huge plate glass windows of their showroom. That did stop me from going in reverse, and I just put in Drive like nothing had happened and left jet black drag marks all the way across the parking lot to the main road.THAT was my response to the three hours I spent there and how I was treated.they didn&#146;t even call the police after I crashed thru the showroom in Reverse- My parents weren&#146;t the least bit upset or angry at me over the $8k in damage I caused to their $45k 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland after I told them what I had been thru! I started the video recording on my cell phone shortly intp the ordeal just to record the audio, which it did. By the end of the following week, after contacting Mazda N.A. and telling sharing the audio recording, the Internet Sales Manger, New Car Sales Manager, General Manager and Finance Manager at the dealer were all Terminated for Cause per a Written Directive from Mazda N.A and the owner of the dealership was given a harsh and formal reprimand. He no longer owns that or any other dealership!

I need to quit rambling and go take a Valium after that, but at least I won! I went the following week to Knoxville, TN and the Southeast Regional VP at Mazda N.A. arranged fort the me to be in-and-out in les than 30 minutes, loan docs and all! I got was greeted by the GM and Sales Manager in the parking lot (I had called to let them know I when I was about 10 minutes out) and 25 minutes later I was doing a quick walk around to make sure the car was absolutely flawless. The VP from Mazda had arranged for a $2500 VIP Customer Rebate (as it was shown on the paperwork) and it also had almost Satellite Radio and about $500 in other accessories thrown in for free!

I didn&#146;t ask or expect the freebies or the big discount, but when I replaced my &#146;07 Explorer last November, I chose a Mazda (CX-9 Grand Touring) and I drove just over 400 miles round-trip to buy it from the dealer in Knoxville! My next Mazda will come from there as well.

192,nyccarguy,August 2013,"Good write up on the 320i. Thx. Still too rich for my blood. Priced up a 320xi on the BMWUSA website with leatherette, metallic paint, Bi-Xenons, backup camera, & hot seats. MSRP was north of $39K.

193,dino001,August 2013,"I agree. It basically costs close to previous generation 328 with nice six-cylinder, better handling, better interior.

BTW, I just got a 328i loaner - my climate control unit lost power, perhaps it is just a fuse, but I was already at the dealer's lot, when I realized that as a possibility, so I just left it for them to figure it out. It's a first failure on the car, almost two years out of the gate. Will see what it is.

It looks like the loaner got this leatherette thing (and moonroof, as well). First touch is OK, but I see it wears much faster (the car has mere 2000 miles and I already see some marks on the seats).

I still hate the steering, but probably not as much, as the first time. Engine and tranny are fast, but oh so rough, especially at a start. Interior is definitely worse in feel. I got aluminum inlays and they seem look OK at first, but after a closer examination they are prone to scratches and gouges. The car DOES NOT feel like $40K+ inside. To add insult to injury, the USB port does not recognize my iPod nano (my car does). I just can't wait to get my car back and it looks I'm not getting a new 3-series any time soon.

In fact, it looks more and more to me BMW went completely insane with pricing. I was so lucky to get my wagon when I did. Similar configuration (added AWD, cause no RWD on wagon and automatic) would be 5-6 grand more on the sticker. Adjusting for AWD, it is about 3-4 grand more - AND it seems they went cheap on interior, namely switches, buttons, etc. I concluded that BMW went completely insane with pricing AND they actually lowered quality of materials at the same time. It amounts into adjusted 20% price increase (money plus quality). All it buys is larger space and better fuel economy. Perhaps some people think it's a good trade off, I personally hate it and it really casts big doubt into what will be my next car. To get me into one of those new ones in some non-specific point in the future will take a discount no BMW dealer is likely to be will be willing to give me. Things happen, but I have to start compiling alternative list.

Which dealer did you participate in the ""drive event""?

I saw an article last week...maybe just a blurb about the recent uptick in the U.S. auto industry, so can't remember the source. But, it went on to state that the new Lexus ES350, with supposedly more sporting pretensions, is suffering a significant sales decline, with the new model.

So, as BMW gets closer to the Lexus's coddled feeling, Lexus is moving closer to the previous BMW's sporting nature.

All the cars in this class are going to end up at a crossroads, where the only differences will be minute, at most.

If not leather than a premium fabric (like microfiber) would actually be better, IMHO - but I'm sure it wouldn't sell. Some (manye?) people buy those plastic leather immitations of leather for similar reason they would buy fake Rolex or Gucci, even if Timex or Casio would actually serve them better as time pieces.

Driving through a dealership window at full throttle makes you sound like a hot-head and a little un-balanced.

I honestly believe these 320i are being marketed to those people who want to be seeing in a BMW. $40 Grand is a lot of money for what you get. I think the new Mercedes is priced even better.

The MB-Tex, or whatever it is called is a nice fake leather, so dealers order majority of those C250 and even C300, or C350 with those seats. At least in case of 328 and 335, majority get premium package, which has leather. Kind of sad. I'm hoping that when the novelty wears off, which should be soon enough, in couple of years they'll start adding leather as one of those ""no cost options"", or at some lower price, call it ""value package"", or similar. Something like that seems to be going on already in other areas, most cars get ""build credit"", which I'm not sure what it means, but smells to me like a simple cash rebate.

I doubt it. This is BMW's business model. They lure you in with (relatively) reasonable base prices, but EVERYTHING is an additional cost option. One of the reasons I bought an A4 years ago rather than the BMW of the time was that the Audi had a lot of things standard. on the BMW: leather - extra cost; certain paints - extra cost; even a folding rear seat - extra cost."

They had number of accommodations, like no-cost automatic (it was $1000, IIRC when it started) and at the very end leather became complimentary no-cost option (part of value package). This was last year or two, though, I think if I remember it correctly. BTW, folding rear seat became standard on 328 and 335 (woohoo!). It is still $500 option on 320.

Forget Nav too. But we all know BMW wont do it and people in their forum know that BMW wont do it. It seems people aren't willing to except the fact that the BMW that we all knew isn't the BMW of today.

Your wish on no frills true performance car may be something interesting, but I bet it wouldn't sell, not at prices they want to charge. My biggetst beef with the so called average buyer is that they look at 3 series or some other sports sedan and complain it's too small in the back seat, or suspension is too hard, or steering too heavy, to which the company responds by turning it into a Buick.

Any time I go to the EU, it always seems I get stuck with a ""stripper diesel"" from the rental agencies. Plus, you see a whole lot of diesels on the road. Granted, gasoline costs 2X-3X what it costs in the U.S. And, most cars there are teeny cars compared to here in the U.S. because most roads in the cities are little more than alleys (no, I do not have any sort of desire to drive a small car every day....let the Europeans do that).

So, the desires of the U.S. market are quite different than those in Europe. Plus, at least up until now, the Germans have been able to get what they're charging for ""premium"" cars with lots of options.

I've liked the BMWs I've owned. I like the Audi I now have. I will say, it's been a long time since I've had a car as troublesome as the Audi, though.

The fact that BMW is really going in a direction where the price is going up, but the performance and the quality of the materials (i.e. letherette vs leather) is going down, makes me want to look elsewhere for my next vehicle in 18-24 months.

I think the real value in the Lexus, Acura, etc, with their reliability, high quality, is becoming more apparent to me, as well as more appealing....expecially at their price points.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
219,markcincinnati,August 2013,"In July the one Cincinnati Infinti dealership had a ""special preview"" of the new Q50 -- they offered up finger foods, wine, soft drinks and a complimentary gift of Infiniti wine glasses and a Q50 key-ring that contained a USB drive with lots of free space to spare after the Q50 advert.

The car in question -- which we could look at but not drive -- was a fully maxed out version; I'd expect it to have an MSRP of just south of $54K.

The Infiniti ""factory rep"" was, naturally, on hand to welcome the ""faithful"" and to regale us with stories about the recent head-to-head comparison that Infiniti pulled together, pitting the Q50 against like-priced Audi A4's and BMW 3's. Now, if you have priced yourself at $53K, the competition in this group could be pretty formidable; or would it?

Well, the content is where these vehicles part company quickly. If you backed off on the $3,200 Infiniti ""technology"" (high nanny content) package, you are able to see why Infiniti is confident that if you shopped these three vehicles on PRICE, that the Infiniti would out-content the two Germans. If you configured these cars similarly on features and options, the Infinti again edges out the German rivals since it would come in at a price advantage.

Infiniti is selling value -- or so it seems -- wrapped up in a capable of keeping up with (and the Infiniti rep claimed, beating) the German offerings on the track. Any way you cut it where price and/or configuration was used to come up with ""similar,"" the Infiniti wins.

Naturally, Infiniti wants you to compare the Q50 to the A4 and 3-series based on price -- the Germans just seem to have bloated MSRPs when compared with the Q50.

OK, now I've driven the Q50 AWD Premium, Sport. There is no way I'd kick this thing out of bed for eating crackers -- I'd probably bring the crackers, in fact. This car is seriously nice (albeit still a bit on the small side, inside -- considering its wheelbase).

The compelling argument isn't that the Q50 elevates Infiniti to making the BMW be called ""the German Infiniti,"" not yet anyway. The compelling argument is that despite my personal issues with the way the options have been grouped into bloated packages, the Q50 at $50K seems to offer so much more car (content, at least; performance can be argued, however) for the money. I understand why Infiniti wants to position comparisons to its rivals based on price.

Of course, a new Q50 here in our market can be leased for $399 per month, which further underscores the value prop.

Typically (or ""often"") I read car comparos where the cars are configured to be close in features and specifications -- but often without any price parity. Then, the comparos are made, the points tallied and a winner emerges. Sometimes there will be a nod to price when there is a second tallying up of the points under the heading of ""price dependent.""

If you put an Audi A4 2.0T SLine together, it can easily zip right past $50K -- and we all know how easily that can be done with a 4-cylinder BMW 3 series, too. If the Q50S -- at a price point -- is test driven against the two Germans, at the same price point, I'll wager that today's most desirable customer -- the Millennials -- will go for the Q50 time and time again -- assuming they don't also try a new KIA Cadenza which is, as Car and Driver says: ""The Cadenza is Kia's first legitimate offering in the near-luxury segment, and it's a good one.""

The Millennials will certainly ""Like"" the choices in front of them -- assuming they care about cars, which is not a foregone conclusion.

220,michaellno,August 2013,"Someone here said something nice about the new Mazda 6 -- the Germans better watch out, their Brand Equity may be in some peril.

That might have been me. While I haven't driven the Mazda 6, or the 320i, or the G37/Q50, I suspect that the gap between 'regular' brands and 'premium' brands is shrinking.

My best friends sister is looking for a new car .. her Mazda Protege died after 220K miles. He was thinking she should get an Acura TL. I suggested either a Honda Accord or Mazda 6 - the tech is almost as good for much less money.

What, exactly, are you getting with your mid-$30's BMW 320i versus a loaded Mazda 6 at $32K or so? More tech in the Mazda. Real leather. Similar HP (180 for the BMW; 185 for the Mazda). Better mileage (38 MPG hwy for the Mazda).

Oh, that's right - the blue and white roundel on the hood.

I think there are still some BMW's worth owning .. personally, I wouldn't mind having a 128i in the garage - 6 cyl, RWD, classic BMW. But, the new 4-cyl turbos? Er, not so much."
221,dino001,August 2013,"I think there are still some BMW's worth owning .. personally, I wouldn't mind having a 128i in the garage - 6 cyl, RWD, classic BMW

You know, it got me thinking. BMWs that are worth having are either the one you mentioned or all those trully high priced models, top of the line of each model, like 335, 550, M, etc. You pay up and it is not for everybody's pocket, mine either, BTW. However, those models at least deliver on the promise at arguably too high price, but they deliver nevertheless. All those entry level models, like 320s, 328 with leatherette, 528i are nice, but fall short on almost every possible metric, from value, to performance, to equipment. To me they represent even less value than those upper models with overpriced options on them. I wouldn't buy every option, but getting this thing without HID lights, sports seats, or some other conveniences simply does not make sense to me at all. Four cylinder turbo in 328 is at least quick, even if rough. Not sure how 320 performs, but they drop 70 hp out of it and get only 2 mpg extra on highway. Seems like a terrible tradeoff to me. However, I guess for the right price, one could still be OK with it. Perhaps the 320 will also be more durable, but that is only to be seen in the future, no guarantees or figures to support such hypothesis.

Those 528, 320, even 328 to certain extent are basically badge lease ""stay below X/month"" ""aspirational"" buyer products. To me it's a clear cut - if I buy one, it has to be a good one, not a half baked badge. If one looks for a true value, go with Infiniti or Acura and they should be happy. The entry level compromises from Munich or Stuttgart are not that great, IMHO - only their rich brothers are worth something.

Now, however, I'm not sure how much love I feel for them. I find it hard to spend $40K+ on a car and get less equipment than you can get on something that's $10K less.

It's my opinion that the x20i and x28i models are for those exactly as you state .. for those who want the Roundel at a specific price point. BMW, like most manufacturers, are trying to expand the size of their clientele. For BMW (and MB and Audi), the only direction they can go, socio-economically, is down. Hence the 320i and the CLA and the 1/2-series and the new A3 sedan.

Which will compete against the top line versions of the Accord, Mazda 6, Altima, etc. The value proposition just isn't there.

I'll grant you that the Mazda is FWD and the BMW is RWD. Lots of folks have posted that the latest generation 3-series is 'softer' than those that came before it, while the Mazda still has the 'zoom zoom' personality.

I think BMW could make all people happy, they could build a 320i or 328i or 335i, with the old ZPH package. Increase HP, give the steering the feel of the E46, M sport suspension, seats, short throw shiftier without all the fluff.

Mark, lately I have been leaning more towards an Audi then a BMW, simply because of price, I have built on Audi's a very nice (to me) A4, Premium Plus, 6 spd manual, Sport package, B&O sound system, read thoaix (thoracic) air bags, and MMI for $45K, if push comes to shove I could do without the MMI and have the price $42K. This to me is a bargain in this segment, now your price of 50K is for a top of line A4, which only comes with the 8 spd Tiptronic which is a great transmission. I think AUdi has a edge over BMW when it comes price, I can't build a 328i for 42K and get the options I get on the Audi or for 45K either. BMW will have to do something in regards to it's price, granted, the ""badge"" people will only follow for so long before the price is too high an start looking else where.

233,graphicguy,August 2013,"You guys make some really good points. Fed, don't know why, but I thought you lived near me. Thanks for the input.

Mark....I really couldn't agree any more with your assessment.

FN....don't let me scare you away from Audi. I really like the car. It's been a long, long time since I've had to go to the dealership as much as I have with the Audi, however. That said, they do their best (at least the one furthest from me does their best) to ease any inconvenience I have to endure.

And, as all of you state....the new BMWs are good cars. They just aren't good BMWs. We'll see how this plays out for them. Personally, no way, no how I'd pay $40K plus for a 320i. Going to the other spectrum, no way, no how, I'd pay high $50s for a 335ix.

So, I guess their sweet spot is the 328ix. But, even there, you're knocking on the $50K door, optioned up.

There are a lot of cars that will be well within the performance ball park of those BMWs for a lot less money.

That's where the Acuras and Infinitis start to make more sense.

Even the new MB CLA or the Caddy ATS look better than a 320i.

Maybe the new 4 series would lure me in. Then again, I'm sure that's going to be priced higher than the 3.

Maybe BMW isn't looking for that repeat buyer. Maybe they just want the new buyer in the hopes that as they get older they'll have no issues keeping them in the brand's family. So many of us former owners making a change for something else, though.

2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
235,dino001,August 2013,"Wonder, what exactly, they're trying to do?

It's called money, market share, cashing out, responding to popular demand. How many times you heard people complaining that 3-series (or A4, or C-class) was too small inside, rode too harsh, had too heavy steering. For majority of people bigger car is a better car, one they can justify spending more money (especially in sedan category), also good road feedback is interpreted as faults in design. So the logic seems like this: BMW knows they (still) have a REPUTATION of sporty car with great image and as you know being sporty and young is everything in media world. However, the true sport is unpallatable for people who have no concept of why car actually moves forward and back. They know there is an engine, because that's the part making noise, but other parts of vehicle, like transmission, suspension, drive shafts, etc. are more like Klingon or Suahilli to them. So BMW knows it is pointless to convince Joe the Doctor, or especially his entitled wife, son, or daughter (it could also be Jane the Lawyer, to make it gender equal) that sporty cars need to be smaller, driver a bit harder and use more fuel. It's easier to change the car and still market it, like it were once removed from Formula 1 or Le Mans. ""Everybody"" wins - Joe/Jane (and their family) get a ""sporty"" car, BMW gets a fat check.

The people who actually gave that image and advocated it to Jane/Joe don't really matter, they are minority and in BMWs view have nowhere to go, anyway. Of course, Lexus, Infiniti, or Acura beg to differ, but nobody listened so far. However, more and more people seem to be tuning in and who can blame them. If you can get car that's not that different for (sometimes much) less and you even get extra ponies, or better reliability, or ""stuff"" inside, why hold onto something that's no longer so special.

239,andres3,August 2013,"I really want to see what a FWD entry German car will drive like.....

Go drive an Audi A3. I seriously doubt the others can do a FWD performance entry level luxury car as well. If you hate sport backs/hatches/wagons, wait one more year for the new A3/S3 sedans to come out that will blow away the competition. Of course, they are going to be slightly smaller than your C250/3-series offerings, but still bigger than a 1-series. They say the CLA is bigger than C series; strange... hope it's not heavier.

I've looked very closely and detailedly at all the available sport sedans in the 35K to 50K range (including new Accord and 6 for good measure), and I can tell you that you get a lot of value and bang for your buck at Audi. There is simply a lot of cost cutting I saw in the '13 G37 and '14 ATS, even more than what you see in a '09 335i.

To show you how far down BMW has sunk, the BMW of San Diego dealer either had zero or one single 335i models in stock, and I don't think it's because they were selling like hot cakes. He said it would take him 20 minutes to ""go get"" and show me the only one he had, and I was like no thanks. They had plenty of 320 and 328's. I built a 335i with quite a lot of options on the website for about $45K, not sure why people would get 328 or 320 if that was accurate, guess that proves they are badge buyers.

The S4 is the most expensive car I looked at, but it was also the best, and it had the least amount of noticeable cost cutting/bean counter penny pinching moves. I'd say Acura TL comes in 2nd in that regard close with BMW. Next Lexus, then Infinity, and worst is ATS. Admittedly, the G37 is an old design, and it shows (all of the competition's interiors have exceeded it handily; not just Audi's). I didn't even look at the Q50 because when I asked the salesman what was new, he listed a whole lot of NANNY Driver automation features, a slew of gadgets that had nothing to do with improving the car's fun driving experience, and offered nothing else (okay, 2 more HP; big whoopee). Not one new feature interested me whatsoever, as I can drive just fine without the driver assistance gimmicks. Amazingly, he said all the new gizmo's didn't raise the price; which he later admitted was probably about $5K off from being accurate.

Want examples of cost cutting shames?

1) In the ATS and G37 the moon roof cover felt like a piece of cardboard with extremely poor fit and finish. It slides loosely all around, left and right, up and down as you move it from open to closed.

2) I believe both (100% on G37) forget to put any door sill trim piece on the rear doors. Infinity has an upgrade option where you can get a lit up Infinity nameplate on your aluminum door sill at the front, but even with that extra cost option, you just get a black plastic sill plate on the rear.

3) Check out the trunk lining and finishing.

4) Brake calipers are at front instead of the more weight balanced rear of the rotor (TL, G37 included)

5) Why can Audi (and even low cost VW) get rid of the ugly roof rail seams/joints black plastic, but BMW, MB, Acura, and Infinity can't? BMW at least paints/colors the trim plastic to match the body, the others don't even bother. I guess this is why everyone has 2 or 3 versions of black and it's so popular a color?

6) If you haven't developed a dual clutch auto-manual transmission, you are behind the times power-train wise. All the other auto transmissions are just gimmicky with shift paddles, S-modes, and all that non-sense. If it isn't a direct shift gearbox that uses a clutch, then don't pretend to be; it's like fake hood scoops or something. Once you go DSG, it's tough to live with anything else. Next best is Honda's new CVT which doesn't feel like a CVT; even better than TL's 6-speed. Even 8 gears doesn't change the fact a slushbox is still a slush-box :sick:

The CLA has the most promise in AWD AMG tuning, but I'm sure it'll cost a fortune based on C63 prices.

That being said, if I could get a brand new 335i for $45K that would be the way to go. 328i should be $35K well equipped.

In fact, I'm betting a lot, as I just made an offer on one at an Audi dealer, and they accepted it! 50K for a custom ordered just the way I want it, nothing I don't, lightly optioned S4 MSRP comes out to $54,095 (I should have it in 3 months). A tremendously great bargain and I'm actually surprised they said yes so quickly to the deal. Every S4 you find at the dealer is optioned up to the gills from $55K to $61K MSRP which makes them very expensive (go with less options, more car). Never understood features or gadgets causing someone to get an ultra optioned up A4 over a less optioned up S4 at similar prices.

If all you want is features and gadgets, why not just get a Korean car? MMI is nearly $4K after taxes, why not just mount a laptop or IPAD in the car for 1/4 the cost? The options are definitely where they are making their money and profit. I want more car value for my money, not more bells and whistles. My $50K + is going for the S4, not an A4.

But I agree, Audi's are a bargain at every price point from what I've seen of the competition and their prices.

Options I got had everything to do with either the looks or the drive of the car:

S4 Base = $48,000 + $895 Destination

1) Misano Red Pearl Paint $500
2) S-Tronic Dual Clutch Auto-Manual $1500
3) Sport Rear Differential $1,100
4) Bang & Olufsen (since I'm kind of an Audiophile, and it was a bargain stand-alone upgrade) $850
5) Full Complete Fine Nappa Leather Interior Seats, trim, door armrests, and contrasting stitching all around, in Magma Red inserts (this was the only and last option I wasn't sure on and had a big debate on whether it was worth the price increase; I believe it is after investigation in person, and I'm not a huge leather fan, but I like the contrasting color options and fine detail improvements, in addition to the leather material being better quality with this package). $1,250

I admit this is way below TMV and a tremendous amount of car for the money if you ask me.

Really the differences amount to the sophistication of the drive train, FWD vs. RWD or AWD, the suspension tuning and refinement is huge (although the ATS lacks that), the bigger better brakes, the extra HP (although BMW likes to break that rule), and less de-contenting/cost cutting measures you can see.

I found it interesting that BMW mecca (SoCal) they don't have more 335i's, SD BMW has about 90 328i's, ranging from 35K all the way up to 51K, and many 320is in the 35K range. Lots of X1's and X5's on the lot, it seems that in San Diego, 328i's, X1's, and X5's sell pretty well."

I'm looking at used A5's, however, I have eyed a couple used S5's. San Diego Audi has no S5's, which I was surprised. For this trip I have a 2014 328i as a rental, I'm surprised it has premium and sport package. The ride is typical German, firm yet controlled, steering is too light for me, but over all, not bad."

248,graphicguy,August 2013,"Andres...congrats. The S4 is a very nice car.

Yours is almost equipped the same as mine. I didn't go for the metalic paint (mine is Ibis White). I didn't opt for the ""fancier"" leather, either.

Everything else is the same, however.

Yours has to be coming in just a bit north of $55K MSRP, right? I don't remember exact numbers, but being an Audi supplier, we were able to buy the car for 6% off MSRP. Audi doesn't seem to rebate or subsidize leases like BMW does.

Problems aside, you're going to have fun with it. BTW, supposedly mine is done tomorrow, after Audi having it a week. It's supposed to be totally cured of all its ills. We'll see.

FN....as scarce as S4s are, S5s are even scarcer. And, I can't for the life of me see why there is such a price difference between the two. Yes, the S5 is a coupe, with slightly different body work from the S4. But, the chasis and drivetrain are the same. The interior is the same. The features/options are the same. Yet, I haven't seen one S5 (of the few new ones I've seen) with an MSRP under $60K.

Funny thing about the 335i. You'd be hard pressed to find much of a selection of them, anywhere you look. I don't know why either. Yes, it can be optioned up to $60K (which puts it on par, options-wise, to a $55K S4). A stripper 335i, if you could find one, might be available for $45K. But, good luck finding one of those.

To me, just the mere fact that the 335i has a much sweeter 6 cyl than the 4 cyl in the F30s might be worth the price delta. Still, the price vs performance equation seems to be tilting precipitously towards the price end of the scale. That's not a good thing.

250,ivan_99,August 2013,"Just this week I aided a co-worker in her automobile search. We compared a new Accord and a used 2012 TL. The 2012 TL (non-SHAWD) was just under $27K and around 20k miles.

In addition to the items you listed it also has the better warranty and is a luxury brand (in her eyes). The TL does seem like a bargain if you don't mind the styling (looks 'ok' to me).

Going -used- throws a bunch of variables into the mix and it is not really apples to apples."
251,markcincinnati,August 2013,"You wrote: ""we all know that BMW wouldn't make a no frills sport sedan. . . ""

Perhaps you should amend that by adding . . .that they would export to the US (and probably some other regions as well.) Although my last visit to Germany was in 2006, I have been there about 25 times and several times I have rented (from Avis or Hertz, etc) cars for part of my time in Europe -- primarily so that I can drive on the Autobahn.

Audi, BMW and Mercedes alike make and sell many ""no frills"" vehicles and versions of the cars we get here in the US that are way way down scale in features, functions, content and performance.

Many European taxis are base-r than basic German cars -- no carpet, plastic seats, no ""glintzy"" trim bits puny, puny powerplants -- and completely devoid of any kind of bling or high-end pretense.

It seems to me that there is room for these ""high end"" [German] manufacturers to bring all kinds of higher end and lower end products to the US. In fact it is probably quite easy to bring out less expensive versions of our market (i.e., premium) Audis, BMWs and Mercedes across the board (within reason, of course).

Moreover, it seems folks will, given the choice and a way to justify the cost, always take the Acura over the Honda, the Audi over the VW, the Lexus over the Toyota and the Infiniti over the Nissan (to name a few.)

And, unless the manufacturer is so stupid as to not differentiate between the Lexus and the Toyota, there will be a very noticeable difference between the pedestrian and the sublime versions.

I think gone are the days where the emperor truly had no clothes -- today there is a wide margin between the Chevy Impala and the Cadillac XTS -- and the price reflects the difference (and perhaps OVER reflects it, to be fair and balanced.)

The VW Quantum and the Audi 4000 (remember when?) were much more like fraternal twins then than any more recent models.

You may believe (and I typically agree) that the Infiniti isn't worth the uptick in price over a ""similar"" Nissan, but the Infiniti (or whatever you're on about) is different, more -- and most pros and amateurs alike would say ""better.""

There is an apropos phrase that mostly fits here: ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten. . . .""

Now of course I could be wrong (but not uncertain) -- but if I am wrong, then by this time next year we'll ALL be buying and driving KIA Cadenza's -- 'cause lordy lordy there ain't nuttin' that even comes close to this puppy at any price.

I have been, more than once, unable to afford the ""better car"" (I'm driving a freakin' Acura TL for pity's sake -- after years of only having Audis -- I am living proof!) -- but I never stopped thinking the car I had to pass on (due to my financial circumstances) wasn't worth its asking price.

I'm already counting down the days until I will return to my favorite German car dealership (and, to be fair, I will also check out what Acura and Infiniti are offering up at the moment of truth). We all rationalize -- or at least most of us do; but it is unlikely that a fine high-zoot German sedan will seem similar to even the best Mazda 6. We tell ourselves that the Mazda is just as good (or close enough) as the German (or whatever premium car is your first love) offering to rationalize our choices.

I could live with an Acura TL -- if I have to -- for years, they are very good cars and good values (and they seem durable as all get out). But, if I am in a position to return to the REAL Premium brands (and you know who they are), I'll do so in a New York Minute.

Drive it like you live."
252,graphicguy,August 2013,"Mark....I should fall into your camp, but I don't. I DO own an Audi, and I DON'T believe its price justifies the premium over a more ""pedestrian"" (as you feel) Acura or Infiniti.

Is the Audi a nice car? Absolutely. I've rented plenty of VWs when I travel. I can see there are more premium bits in the Audi than there are in the VW. I also see the things that are the same.

Personally, I'll never again take for granted what the Japanese Premium Brands excel in....that is reliability, longevity, brick like build quality. Those things do indeed matter....a lot.

Of course this little diatribe comes hot on the heels of picking up my allegedly repaired S4 this a.m at 7:30 a.m. There was a littany of things the dealer did. None of them fixed the problem (as I learned when I got half way home), and now they've introduced some squeaks and rattles into my console area (supposedly caused by removing and replacing the MMI). Quattro is still ""binding"", but not as much as before.

So, either live with it. Or, keep schlepping it to the dealer.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
253,markcincinnati,August 2013,"I do feel your pain -- my first (and only) new A8 spent more time (or it seemed that way) at the dealership than in my garage.

Generally speaking you did take my message as I meant it. My thoughts, however, regarding the status of the cars would be to call the VW the pedestrian vehicle -- the Acura and Infiniti are, to me at least, still in a ""class"" that is above the pedestrian Honda and Nissan.

I had an S6 a few years back and I loved it -- yet it too spent too much time in the dealership's repair bay.

But I have not had what I would call a totally confidence inspiring experience with my Acura. My issues with my Acura TL SH-AWD are -- if I am able to pull the emotion out of the equation -- dealer related.

As either an anecdote or a data point -- you decide -- I complained at the first oil change (about 8,000 miles) that there was a noise and sensation that I believed to be warped brake rotors. Every time I touched the brakes at highway speeds there was a ""shudder"" and vibration that felt like warped rotors or wheels that needed balancing.

The dealership decided to ""turn the brakes"" -- in fact they did this exercise two times (to no avail.)

I went to another Acura dealership -- one that has no connection with or to a Honda dealership and their diagnosis was that I had 3 warped wheels (they said they were ""bent"".)

Acura corporate said, ""your fault -- or at least not OUR fault."" But, the dealership (the second dealer, that is) appeared to go to bat for me and was able to get 3 new wheels at 50% of the SRP. This cure for the issue happened around 25,000 miles. Of course the ""overall"" safe/smart/prudent thing to do was to replace all four tires, too (at a cost of about $1,000 from the tire rack.) I also had the new wheels and tires road force balanced -- at a slight discount (at the dealership.) This cure cost about $2K, plus I had the displeasure of driving over 20,000 miles with what felt like warped brake discs.

Otherwise the car has been and my sense is, will remain, both reliable and durable -- but I just can't shake the [emotional, probably] sense that my Acura has (for wont of a better term) ""too much Honda"" in it.

I'd take the S4 any day. Now, I know or at least I think I know what you're thinking: The S4 could be nearly $20K more than the TL -- and typically would be at least $10K more (my TL had back up sensors and other Acura accessories on it for a total MSRP of a bit south of $48K.)

You've had either a bad S4 or an unsatisfying dealer experience -- or both.

Generally speaking I would think both of our experiences have been -- for the respective brands we're talking about -- way below our expectations. Everyone I know of says Hondas, er, Acuras are easily good to go for at least 150K -- with only routine mntce.

Audis, of recent vintage are, typically, also reliable and durable -- and return much more driving pleasure than competing Acuras.

But please note that my ""short list"" when the time comes, in about 11 months, will contain Audi, Acura, Infiniti and probably Volvo. I may even give another look-see at a BMW (probably not, though.)

I may fall victim to the most ""bang for the buck"" car -- which could turn out to be another Acura TL or TLX (or whatever they call it at the time). Right now it seems to me that something like a Q5 with the supercharged engine is a cross between an A4 allroad and an S4 -- for less money (when well equipped) than either of the other 2 Audis.

I hope someone from Audi reads these posts. Were I in that position (a paid forum reader of our rants and raves) I would certainly try to reach out to you ""from the factory"" and make your situation right -- if for no other reason than to turn you into a brand fan, instead of a brand foe.

I still say it is easier to pay too little and regret it than pay what seems to be a bit too much (at the time) and love it.

Good luck with your dealership."
254,andres3,August 2013,"Thanks! As much as my finances are thanking me a bit for having 3 months to prepare for this HUGE purchase (for my budget, was definitely stretching; but pre-owned S4's seem to be holding their value REALLY well, are popular fast sellers making them rare, and I didn't see the value in a lightly used one if it was going to cost nearly as much if not the same amount (given the usual 60K MSRP they are typically bought at).

If I'm going to spend a large amount of money, Audi or anyone else better believe I'm going to be picky what my money goes towards; so a custom order seemed like the only option to me. Thankfully, Audi still makes enough options stand-alone that you can get it just right! Acura groups too much junk together.

I will admit however, even with the Pro's of having 3 months longer with an old ""cheap"" car to shore up the finances, the con's are I'm anxious and can't wait to get my hands on the new S4! I can see why people without strong will power or color preference just have to have something right now, today! Turns out Escondido dealer only needed $1K down (SD Audi wanted $2,500 down), I emailed my offer to SD Audi, and about 22.5 hours later, without a response, I decided to extend same offer to Escondido Audi in person, and they jumped for it (after a couple of attempts to get me to go up).

I feel just a tad bit bad as the sale-person that helped me previously at SD Audi said they were with clients all day long and just didn't get to my e-mail until after 5. I had assumed and figured the sales manager was mulling/balking over my offer for too long. Probably in hind sight I should have called to make the offer and/or confirm she got the email. However, I'm sure she will learn not to ignore e-mails; it could be an offer to buy!

255,andres3,August 2013,"S4 Fancier leather option: Hardest one to pony up for as it MSRP's at $1,250. However, I noticed all the details it comes with from the fine Nappa Leather all round, to the contrasting stitching (in the color you choose) on the center armrest, shifter, steering wheel, seats, and door armrests. I loved that level of attention and contrast. Most importantly though, at least in the S5, they cut the Alcantara seam about 1/2 to 1"" too high on the upper seat section. If you lean your upper seat back at all, you can see the vinyl mesh material where it meets the lower seat cushion. In the S4, the Nappa leather was cut lower down, so even way leaned back, you couldn't' see the less desirable seat trim.

Audi Club North America members in good standing also get the same supplier 6% discount. That's a very good deal! It's well below Edmund's TMV of average transaction prices for the S4. However, I needed a GREAT deal in order to go new. With the ""fancier"" leather, I was over my stretched $50K threshold (before taxes), without it, I met my price target. So my offer was $850 below the 6% discount. Probably around 6.4%? I didn't do the math exactly. My A3 ownership also gives me $1,000 loyalty rebate back on the back end after taxes as well. In CA, sales tax is ridiculous so figuring 10% for tax, title, license, and fees is about right I'm told.

2014 S4 has Audi Drive Select standard, in exchange for raising the MSRP $500 bucks from 2013. The Sport Diff option went down $150 from 2013 probably because Drive Select is already on the car. I told them the price increase wasn't my fault, I'm sticking to my offer at $50,000.

256,andres3,August 2013,"If the 335i new is the same price as the S4, I made the right decision in my book; hands down.

Maybe I accidentally clicked on a 328i when I equipped it for $45K (or maybe I was looking at Invoice price on 335i)?

I liked the power in the '09 335i sport package sedan (the drive, not really the interior), and if it wasn't for the brakes locking up, I might have liked it enough to buy it (and it had shameful All-Season tires). Carmax lowered the price on it to make up for the bad tire selection I see... tempting... ..

It had a heavy effort filled steering similar to the '11 S4 I test drove, which I liked on both. I have to admit, I preferred the higher effort steering in the older S4 to the '13 S4 I test drove (not a deal breaker though; just a preference). In 2013 they went electromechanical steering supposedly for efficiency. Since the gas mileage didn't change, I can only assume it made a .5 MPG impact or less and rounding variance didn't help them.

I have a thing for nice steering wheels. As much as I loved the old steering wheel in the Audi's, the new '13/'14 version is even nicer! I didn't think Audi could top the previous version, but they did!

If looks and style don't matter to someone (or your tastes just differ), the TL is definitely a value bargain buy right now.

If Audi rejected my $50K offer (not including fees/taxes) after trying at like 5 dealers, I'd of probably offered Acura $40K out the door on a TL-SH AWD Tech (37,500 + taxes - 1,500 conquest rebate). About 2K below TMV, not sure if that would have flied?

As the most recent cross shopper of the TL-SH AWD vs. S4 here on this board and forum, I can say that I couldn't justify a full $15K delta, but close to it seemed rational to me. That is why I needed to get Audi to agree to an offer that kept the S4 within that $15K delta with the Acura (assuming TMV best deal on Acura).

262,dino001,August 2013,"I think the ""is"" is available on coupe only because it is old E90 platform. It used to be available on sedan as well, but they switched the platforms. New 4-series won't have ""is"" trim just yet, either.

The ""is"" trim is usually a mid-cycle refresh gimmick to maintain sales and buzz on models that are no longer ""all new"", to keep them running. IIRC, it wasn't available on the new platform with 330i right away, either. Then when they brought the turbo six engine (335i), it wasn't there either until some time has passed. If the patterns were to repeat, we should see (hopefully) some ""is"" trims available on the new F30 platform, as the novelty wears off. It (the novelty) already has passed for sedans, but you still have brand new wagon, GT, 328 diesel, 320, the 4-series coupe coming just in 2013, /2014 season. The convertible is next, I'm sure. Once the entire lineup is complete, the sedan will come with a refreshed look, as it always does and some additional stuff, to keep the interest and push early lessee adopters from 2012 to getting into 2015/16. I think that would be a perfect time for them to introduce the ""is"" trim on F3x lineup.

All manufacturers try to spoonfeed their new stuff, so there is always something to talk about. BMW actually brought a lot of new models this year, so they'll wait with incremental improvements until they see buzz dying off.

That said, I tcompare the two Audi dealerships in my 'burg to my BMW dealership, and there's a night and day difference with the advantage going to BMW. Even when I had my Acura, my preferred dealer took very good care of me.

As I mentioned previously, it might have been because I bought my S4 in Chicago and am having it serviced in Cincinnati. But, I really don't buy into a dealership treating you better if you buy the car from them. Warranty work is paid the same regardless. And, let's face it, service work has a whole lot more margin than new car sales.

I think the training, the time spent understanding the cars, the amount of time spent daily focused on customer service (or lack thereof) becomes evident in the way they take care of your problems.

Your Acura dealership experience would have prompted me to send a strongly worded letter to Acura corporate. Your car is what? A year old? And already has warped rotors?

This leaves 328 for buyers who like those options, like better seats (Sport/M-Sport) and/or interior inlays (Lux) and are able/not mind paying. I think over time the trend will be more pronounced as 320 replaces entry 328 trims.

I have to admit I'd of been more comfortable had the dealer given me a ""buy-order sheet"" with all the numbers listed. I suppose they can't control what sales tax might be 3 months from now. The $50,000 + fees figure is written down.

Also, he says the loyalty rebate comes from Audi of America at delivery; not from the dealer, and is a good program through 1/7/14. That gives a nice buffer should my order be delayed; all hell would break loose should they terminate that loyalty rebate early or deliver the car after that date (and the program not extended).

With my first luxury dealership servicing experience with Audi (they used to give free maintenance for 50K miles), I feel as if problems on a luxury car are not nearly as big of a deal. If they give you a nice loaner car, it makes it even less troublesome. I look at the bright side; you get a chance to wear and tear there car's rather than your own. No miles on your own car while they work on it makes me feel like I'm in no hurry. Of course, my longest repair job came when I got an A4 loaner, which wasn't typical at my old Audi dealership. I have a feeling that's why Miramar Audi is now know as Audi of San Diego and under different ownership. I ratted them out on customer service Audi surveys as routinely giving Enterprise Kia Sephias and Chevy Aveo's instead of Audi or VW's.

While the Accord passed the daily driver test, it could not be tracked. Not even a 280 HP FWD version could legitimately be tracked. That didn't stop me from thinking about option 1 being a possible route to take though.

The TL-SH-AWD Tech package has the back up cam, probably why it costs $3,500 for the Tech option that has some things I liked, but at that added price the S4 seemed like more bang for the buck to me. The TL-SH-AWD needed to be about $2K less with the tech package to steal a deal from me; not having a back up cam gets them partly there.

317,igozoomzoom,August 2013,"I traded in a 2007 Explorer on a 2012 Mazda CX-9 last year. The CX-9 came with a standard Rearview Backup Camera. The Explorer had Rear Park Assist (Sonar) that would beep when it deetected an obstacle and the frequency of the beeps would increase as you got closer to it.

Initially, I thought the CX-9's camera would be useless. After nine months, I've discovered that it's actually DANGEROUS! If I'm looking at the display in the dash as I back up, I lose most/all peripheral vision to my left side and don't see oncoming vehicles. I just ignore it now and use my mirrors and look over my shoulder instead....

Mazda added the Rear Backup Sensors and a feature called Rear Cross Traffic Alert to the the 2013 model. I bought my 2012 model barely a month before the 2013 was released....the story of my llife!

The Rear Cross Traffic Alert is actually a very interesting and useful feature, IMO. Mazda was one of the first companies to install a Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) system. It was introduced on the 2008 model on the high-end Grand Touring trim level. When I bought my 2012, I chose the Grand Touring because of the 20"" wheels and chrome door handles (sad, but true) and it came with a lot of other features ranging from Blind Spot Monitoring to Rain-Sensing Wipers. At worst, I planned to turn off anything that I didn't like or annoyed me.

The BSM, in particular, sounded ridiculous to me. I figured it was just a case of using technology for technology's sake and nothing more. After nine months and 13k miles living with it, I don't think I'll ever buy another vehicle without it!

I've always thought that blind spots only existed because the vast majority of drivers have no idea how to properly adjust their mirrors. But it turns out that a ful-size CUV/SUV (such as my CX-9) can have hidden spots at the rear corners that I can't see no matter how my mirrors are adjusted. I don't think the BSM or any other techno feature should be trusted 100% and replace common sense and paying attention behind the wheel, but I now see that they can work in conjunction with those.

In my CX-9, when a vehicle is detected by one of the cameras mounted under the rear bumper on both sides, a yellow warning symbol lights up in the top corner of the mirror on that side of the car. If I signal a lane change while a vehicle is detected, a loud series of warning beeps and flashing light on the instrument panel lets me know that someone is back there.

Whenever I'm changing lanes, I always do a quick over the shoulder glance just to be certain that it's clear and the BSM doesn't change that. But even when I have no intention of changing lanes, I find it very useful to always know what's going all around me at all times. Those little yellow warning lights on the mirrors make sure that I always know who or what is around me and I recently discovered that having that knowledge can prevent a serious acccident!

I was driving on I-75 North in Metro Atlanta a few weeks ago following a truck loaded with tree stumps and limbs. With no warning, one of those massive oak stumps tumbled right off the back of the truck and I was going 75mph just one hundred feet or so behind it. I reflexively swerved and avoided it, but swerved to the right rather than the left which woudl have my instinct. But I went to the right because 10-15 seconds earlier, I noticed the BSM warning light on my driver's side mirror in my peripheral vision. Without BSM, I would have went to the left and hit that vehicle!

That experience gave me an ever higher level of appreciation for BSM. It also made me very thankful that I was driving a CX-9 instead of my previous Explorer or most new SUVs of similr size. I don't think anything else could have handled a high-speed emergency maneuver like that without losing control....Zoom, Zoom!

Back to the Rear Cross Traffic Alert feature I mentioned earlier....the BSM cameras scan for oncomoing vehicles when the vehicle is in Reverse and alerts you if it detects anything. For backing out of blind parking spots, it's a god-send. I wish my 2012 had it.

But there are many new 'safety' features showing up on new cars that are way 'over the top'! One of my favorites is on the 2014 Mazda6 known by the acronym FOW. FOW stands for Forward Obstruction Warning, which uses laser sensors mounted behind the front grille to scan the road ahead for obstacles (cars, people, debris) and alerts the driver if it detects something. Every car I've owned, starting way back with my '85 CRX has featured FOW also- it's called a WINDSHIELD!!! You look out of it and, if something is in your way, you stop or go around it....problem solved!

Mazda takes it even further, though. If the FOW system doesn't think the driver has time to respond or no evasive action is taken based on the warning, the system will cut the throttle and apply full braking force automatically!

If you need a car to do all of that for you, you're too dumb or too lazy to drive! The same goes for freakin' Rain-Sensing Wipers....

Those subsidies partially offset the effective price increases (overall cost of car probably did not go as much up as the stickers if we compare it with loans prior interest rate bubble of 2000s), but create a dangerous situation when the rates go up (ad they will). We will be stuck with much higher prices then.
2018 430i Gran Coupe"
337,graphicguy,September 2013,"dino...couldn't agree more. The subsidized financing is what allows manufacturers to sell more and more cars, which masking the price increases.

I can see my own automotive trend over the years. I always put a budget on what I'd pay for a car, based on what I could afford. First, (probably in the late '80s when I bought my first new car) it was $30K. That amount would net me a very nice car.

In the late '90s it balooned to $40K.

Now, I'm well into the $50K budget.

However, I expect more now than I did when I bought my first car, too. Back then, all I wanted was a comfortable, reliable car (which meant a Honda or a Toyota). Now, I want performance. I want luxury. I want reliability. I want all the tech stuff. I want the state of the art suspensions and transmissions. I want good build quality. I want top notch materials. I want styling. I want good fuel efficency. All that costs something.

That leads me to the most recent cars I've had....BMW, Audi, Acura.

Some embody those traits better than others. As of right now, I'm understanding what something like a TL has that I've missed from the German marks. Of course, you won't win many drag races with a TL like you will with an S4, either.

I'm betting that at some point, with the 3 series at least, the Acuras and the Lexi will be able to make another inroad to the German territory (as they did in the '80s) given the price deltas and the softening of the 3.

Over all I liked it, the fit and finish is first rate, the car ""feels"" more expensive, seats were excellent for comfort, the way the car rode was more connected to the road then any other chevy sedan I have driven. The engine is the 3.6; DOHC 306hp, w/ 6spd auto. The engine revved and wanted to go high but of course the fuel cut off kicked in, the 6 spd auto shifted well, good up shift with no hesitation and downshifts were smooth. I was impressed with the car, no rattles, the car almost rode like a German car, but not as refined as one. I have driven two of them one a top of the line 2LTZ and a 2LT. Behind the radio is a ""hidden"" compartment that has a USB port so one could load a iPod or ITouch and leave it there connect and not have to worry about it. The cars had 5 USB ports in it, this is the first car I have had with this many. Ford really needs to do something with their Taurus if they want to be competitive in this segment.

So I liked the car, it is now one of the cars I look for when renting. BTW, so far I have averaged 26 MPG with the cars. I'm sure once they bring the 8 spd/auto into the MPG will go up. I have pictures of the interior but I don't know to upload them."

357,markcincinnati,September 2013,"Johan de Nysschen has his work cut out for him. The new head honcho of Infiniti &#150; formerly of Audi (of America) for almost 20 years &#150; has to do for Infiniti what he did for Audi. He must take a run at making you think of BMW (or Audi) as the German Infiniti. Tall task? Well, based on the lethargic launch of the Q50, I don&#146;t envy Johan.

You may or may not lend much credence to Automobile, Car and Driver, Motor Trend, Popular Mechanics or Road and Track&#146;s gravitas in promoting [automotive] brands. If you discount these magazines&#146; influence, fine &#150; I would imagine, however, you are at least aware of them (especially if you are participating in this and other car-centric forums).

The point I will hopefully make is highly derivative; indeed, without apology, the influence for my conclusions has been shaped by John Naisbitt&#146;s 1982 book, Megatrends. Perhaps I should clarify and sharpen my focus: My point &#150; to be revealed shortly &#150; is based on using a technique of observation and counting how much &#147;ink&#148; is spread pertaining to a particular subject, story or brand or product. Moreover, once the quantity of ink has been identified, it is also of importance to identify and rank the content (or the &#147;qualities&#148;) of the ink.

We&#146;ve all been hearing and reading about the new Q50 for what seems to be a long time (in automotive product life-cycles). We&#146;ve seen full-page ads in the major automotive enthusiasts&#146; magazines for at least a couple of months. What we haven&#146;t seen are test reports, comparison tests and &#147;First Drives&#148; &#150; yet we&#146;re seeing ink (for several months now) about cars that aren&#146;t even available for purchase, e.g., the upcoming Mercedes-Benz CLA45 to name just one.

Audi and BMW, too, seem to be masters at garnering great quantities of ink about cars that are either still on the drawing boards or aren&#146;t yet in production form, e.g., the BMW M4. Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Lexus and even KIA (!) are very adept at keeping the volume of the buzz about their brands and products cranked up to 11.

I just got the new Automobile magazine yesterday (October 2013 issue) &#150; the New Cars for 2014 issue. Page 38 - 40, &#147;Driven: BMW 435i&#148; offers up less than a review but more than a rehash of the corporate brochure &#150; the car is discussed, albeit briefly, in terms of performance, style, ride and handling. The spread includes pictures of the car&#146;s anterior and posterior as well as its engine and interior (in red leather). This marks at least 2 mentions (ink) of the &#147;4 series&#148; in this issue.

Further evidence of the virtual lack of any buzz regarding new Q50 is the &#147;Sport-Sedan Slugfest&#148; in the June &#146;13 Car and Driver &#150; where the BMW 3, the Cadillac ATS and the Lexus IS duke it out for king of the hill bragging rights. I would have thought Infiniti would have busted its hump to get the Q50S included in the slugfest. I would argue that the Infiniti, not the Lexus would have been the odds-on favorite choice for this comparision article based on the G37 being dubbed (more than once) the Japanese BMW. The highly anticipated (and touted) Q50 being excluded from this comparison is an incredible marketing blunder &#150; especially since Infiniti has been showing off the Q50 for several months now at invitation only dealer events where Infiniti representatives regale the invitees with anecdotes wherein the Q50S betters Audi A4&#146;s and BMW 3&#146;s on the track.

I was, understandably I think, eager with anticipation when I turned to page 56 of the new Automobile magazine to see the mini article, &#147;Driven: Infiniti Q50.&#148; Unfortunately, there is little ink devoted to a discussion of how the car performs. Indeed, what struck me was the following: &#147;. . . the Q50 is not so much an all-new sport sedan as a refreshed and rebodied Infiniti G37.&#148; Most of the remaining ink pertained to the Q50&#146;s ability to [almost] drive itself.

Even an admitted gadget-geek (like me) would likely be underwhelmed by the content of this &#147;ink.&#148; Practically speaking the buzz potentially created by this ink is arguably not the kind of buzz Infiniti probably was hoping for &#150; and it is certainly not the kind of buzz that is likely to retain the brand&#146;s (or the Q50 itself) image as &#147;the Japanese BMW.&#148;

Although I have driven a new very high-contented AWD Q50S and can absolutely attest to its worthiness as an A4 or 3 series (and therefore IS and ATS) rival, this conclusion has been reached in spite of Infiniti&#146;s dismal marketing efforts. I seriously doubt the majority of the market the Q50 seems to be courting will notice the Q50 until (or unless) the ink spread around about it focusses more on the performance, luxury and driving dynamics rather than its expensive technology package that seems hell bent on distancing the driver from, er, driving.

My wife &#150; currently driving a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD Premium &#150; sums it up this way, &#147;Infiniti&#146;s do everything well &#150; but they don&#146;t seem to want to involve their customers as drivers. The Germans, especially Audi and BMW somehow imbue their cars, their dealerships, their owner clubs and web sites with customers who are passionate about the brand. Indeed, the thing lacking from Infiniti is a soul or a passion to both drive and be driven.&#148;

Perhaps that it why even a &#147;pull ahead&#148; deal Infiniti offered her couldn&#146;t compel her to be a two-time Infiniti owner. She went to Audi, BMW and Volvo and drove a like-priced ($50K) Q5, X3 and XC60 and ended up ordering a &#147;passion inducing&#148; supercharged 2014 Audi Q5. Pity, the Infiniti brand (and most of the products individually) can&#146;t seem to catch a break.

The &#147;Megatrends&#148; methodology seems to indicate BMW is unlikely to be known as the German Infiniti any time soon.

358,dino001,September 2013,"I just read an article about sales of 3-series going gangbusters. Basically another piece of evidence that enthusiasts don't matter, at least in short run. People are lining up to buy this ""sports sedan"" probably for reasons why the same people didn't buy them before - it's big, comfy, easy to drive. But it's a BMW, so it must be sporty, right? Since they've never sit in a true sporty car, if they had, they thought it was uncomfortable crap, how would they know the difference, anyway.
Looks to me BMW cashed the chips and they bought huge sale boost. It will be interesting to see long term effects of this. VW made a similar gambit with Jetta and Passat by decontenting them, stripping all those good suspension components and making barges out of them. It worked until it stopped. After couple of years of initial huge boost they hit a wall and sales stalled, even fell at some point. I wonder if same could happen to BMW. Maybe not, who knows. One thing is certain, my not liking (hating actually) the new 3 steering doesn't matter.

361,graphicguy,September 2013,"dino...stickguy....I think you both hit the nail on the head with the 3 series. BMW did cash in their chips on the new one. But, they've been moving away from sports sedan into more mainstream waters for a while now.

I think the thing that BMW has that VW did not, at least in this country, is the cachet of their brand. VW lost their ""cool"" factor a long time ago.

Now, does BMW retain the cool factor after moving their cars into more mundane territory? Remains to be seen and we probably won't know for another decade or so.

markincincinnati.....I think what kills the Q50 is that drivetrain. It's getting long in the tooth. And the NVH factor has never been its strong suit. It might be OK in an Altima or a Maxima. But, in a $50K lux sedan? Not so much!

I'm thinking you did the test drive up at Kings Automall? Those guys used to send me stuff all the time. But, sounds like they had something of a management shakeup as the previous GM who had been there for years, is no longer there.

Does it still exhibit the same characteristics, such as the overly intrusive boy-racer exhaust note, for example? (Some like it, some do not.)"
369,markcincinnati,September 2013,"I drove a fully loaded Q50S AWD. I drove into the dealership in a 2011 FX35 -- I have test driven the M37X's and several other Infinitis within the past 4 months.

The thrash of an Infiniti V6 certainly isn't banished from the new Q50, but it is way way muted in the new evolution of the G sedan. I wouldn't mind having the sound of the Q50 at full-cry enter into the cabin of a Q50 I was driving, it has been so tamed.

I'm not making excuses -- or at least that is not my intent -- I dare say so few people have ever even test driven one of the new Q50's, the product is hardly an issue.

The car's anonymity is what I was remarking upon (in my ""ink"" post) -- due to what I would call damn near a marketing implosion. The Q50 should have had an Audi or a BMW-like launch -- a launch designed to tease, announce, build buzz, showcase and provide plenty of first drives, ""drivens"" and side-by-side comparos. Instead the new Q50 has been brought to market with about as much buzz as there would be for a closeout sale of 2008 full-sized pickup trucks that have been on the lot since, well, 2007.

I don't mean to be carrying Infiniti's water even though I can tell you the Q50S AWD drives like it belongs in a comparison with a new BMW 3, Cadillac ATS, Audi A4 (or even S4) or Lexus IS 350 F Sport.

If you think the Q50 will provide a disappointing aural experience -- especially at full throttle -- you will be proven wrong (happily, I would hope.)

The Q50 does raise the bar in the ""sport sedan"" class (for 15 minutes)-- but, you're right, the engine does need to be re-thought and redesigned. I'd say the transmission can ""keep on"" perhaps for another year or two before it MUST be replaced.

In contrast, the IS 350, which also came to market with an ""old"" engine, has an even more transformed package to distinguish itself from the outgoing IS. And the IS has had a ""crack team"" of marketers getting it in front of the target market. It has been in no less than two comparos already this year -- and its ""handlers"" seem hell-bent on getting the word out on the F Sport version as if to say, ""this is not your grandfather's Lexus.""

I have no reason to want to waste your time, so with that in mind, please take a test drive of a new Q50S AWD and post your impressions.

370,m6user,September 2013,"Maybe the reason the Q50 wasn't included in some of the comparos or extensive test drives was because of availability and the fact that the drive train didn't change that much if at all.

The quality of the interior pieces and the tech impressed them quite a bit.

377,markcincinnati,September 2013,"Puffinalong -- no disrespect taken. And, I can't believe I am somehow seeming (even to myself) to be defending or at least suggesting the G37x, er Q50S(x) deserves to be compared with the Audi and the BMW.

My wife's and my automotive history is overwhelmingly (~93+%) German, overwhelmingly Audi, but also can count 3 BMW's (all awd variants) and 3 VW's (2 Passats and 1 Jetta) among one Infiniti (2011 FX35 Premium AWD) and one Acura (2012 TL Advance SH-AWD). I have been to 5 driving schools, 4 with Audi in Austria and 1 with BMW here in Spartenburg. My wife ""forces"" (not too tough to do) us to test drive no less than 10 automobiles per year, except in the last year of her lease (such as 2013) where she ups the test-drive count by at least 3.

I am (or, better said, we are) capable of providing ""informed"" data points here on Edmunds -- hardly professional, but more than simply casual. We are probably anal in our test driving methodology -- always going over the same routes, same speeds, entering corners at the same speeds and even taking along the same MP3 and/or CD's with us to check out our tester's audio capabilities.

We attempt to drive the SPORT designated models (and always the AWD models) of everything we test drive. We subscribe, at any one time, to no less than four auto enthusiasts magazines (plus Consumer Reports in case we need a new vacuum cleaner) and read and/or watch as many websites and youtube tests as our non-working, waking hours allow. We don't have kids, so we have a lot of time to study up on current automotive fact (and fiction.)

Repeatedly, the ""G"" Infiniti cars have been dubbed ""the Japanese BMW"" -- never once, that I can find, has either Audi or BMW been dubbed ""the German Infiniti"" -- which is partially due to marketing and partially due to the product itself.

Infiniti's sport-sedan creds are not legion-- but they are also not ancient history, either. A nicely equipped G37X/S over the past two or three model years has never been an undesirable vehicle and in some instances it wins categories or comes in as a top two or top three finisher in automobile magazines' comparos (that is automobile with a lower-case ""a"").

Further accolades regarding the Infiniti G can be found by kliking here:

Once again, although I have been impressed with the new Q50S/AWD with the optional steering upgrade, I have not decided to be a two-time Japanese (let alone Infiniti) buyer.

As a member of the Audi Club of NA, I have at least the motivation of a minimum 6% off list discount ""coupon"" to make me revisit the A4 (or possibly A6 with sport package, of course); and Acura is already pushing and prodding me to ""pull ahead"" with an new (2013) TL (but since I have a 2012, it makes me wonder, ""why bother?"") Volvo's S60 T6 type - R is also interesting as is the IS 350 F Sport Lexus and even the new -- albeit routinely bashed -- 3 series. I've even looked at a Chrysler 300S and a Taurus SHO just in case. Part of me will at least mostly seriously give a critical look-see at the Cadillac ATS (and CTS) and the AWD Buick Regal GS.

So, I am not, per se an Infiniti lover nor apologist, nor am I yet willing to reject the Q50 out of hand solely on the merits of a really lackluster marketing campaign.

I remain willing to say the new Q50SX is the best Infiniti ever (that I have driven) and absolutely worth being compared to the Audi A4 and the BMW 3 -- and, if you, like Infinti, compare these three vehicles at ""the exact same price point,"" the Infiniti will win on content even if much of that content, as I noted earlier, seems to be hell bent on removing the driver from driving. . . .

Speaking of that: Drive it like you live."
378,sweendogy,September 2013,"While I love the comments and reviews I wonder what could actually be gained interms of a true review from a simple test drive that lasted 15mins in a controlled environment. I've been to a few apple stores, played around with a few gizmos and thought they were cool but is that a true review of those items? The quotes Japanese bmw, The long post on the Audi discount I don't get- (audi club discount, really?) seems a bit drawn out and forced to prove some point which is never really given, is it a good or is it a tech driven value? Or at the price point, like the g it really is 90% of Bmw driving and 110% Better in tech? I'm going to reserve my own thoughts on the q (ugly name) once I've driven it and once the experts have compared it to its true comp. I would also note for real value seekers, if indeed there is a surplus of q50s on the lot and they are indeed good cars one could take advantage of such a mistake that someone else posted as infinitis fault at launch in lack of proper advertising.

Drive fast, take chances"
379,markcincinnati,September 2013,"I urge you to take a test drive of the Q50S AWD -- which is pretty easy to do since there appears to be NO RWD samples available (at least here in my part of the country).

I encourage anyone who is serious about spending any money on any of the cars discussed in this forum to reserve judgement until post test drive. My response, perhaps too broad, was intended to encourage Puffinalong (and anyone really) to test drive a car before assuming it wasn't worthy of being spoken of in the same breath as Audi and BMW.

Infiniti spokespersons seem to want ""us"" to test drive the new Q50 against such competition as the A4 and 3 series at a price point. And, they do have a point -- at a nominal $50K, the Q50 will present itself with significantly higher content than an A4 or 3 series.

According to Infiniti's product advocates, an Infiniti Q50S (at the same price point) will best an A4 or a 3 series. This may or may not translate to the new Q50 bettering an A4, IS or 3 series in an enthusiasts magazine comparo (Car & Driver for example). Yet the Infiniti marketing execs and product specialists who travel the country on behalf of the brand are able to spout why the Q50 will outgun the A4 and 3 and IS and ATS given a monetary equalizer.

I doubt Car & Driver will limit its test subjects MSRPs to make sure their reviews are ""a fair fight.""

Given no limit (in this context) to price, I would assume that an Audi S4 or S5 or BMW M3 or M4 (not yet available) would be selected by a significant majority of folks -- assuming they didn't have to make the payments.

Given no slack (regarding price), however, I assume most of us will go for the maximum they can get ""for the money.""

Based on the new Car & Driver, I'd be quite willing to take a new RS7 Audi -- for $50K (dream on) were such car actually put on sale at that price.

And, yes, if you are a member of the Audi Club of NA, you do get a certificate good for 6% off list should you want to go that route (or course if you can negotiate anything better than 6%, you should take it!)

Drive it like you live!"
380,markcincinnati,September 2013,"Review in Car and Driver of Q50S Hybrid -- not especially encouraging if you are a fan of the brand.

I'd say the review is stronger about the previous iteration (the G37) than the new one -- too much tech, too expensive, too too.

Back to the A4, 3 and the new IS F Sport if you asked me (but I would still argue in favor of test drive rather than being put off by C/D's take alone.

381,sweendogy,September 2013,"No one is saying a test drive should not be used- but for someone, who is not constantly testing cars to write a review and that said review would be taking over a car mag is just ludicrous. I think a proper comparo test done by more then one mag- with all current contenders pulls more weight then the 15 min test drive you had with a salesmen sitting shot gun. Not saying the information and experience was not of any value, but just less then a James Healey or consumer reports- and another few ticks lower then c&d and others.

Let's get a couple of comparos before we jump to conclusions.

382,markcincinnati,September 2013,"I totally agree -- the early report from C/D however is a bit of a bummer (for those who were rooting for Infiniti and Johan, of course.)

Right out of the gate, the IS 350 gets a positive response, besting even the mighty 3 series.

I have NOT driven the IS -- hence my lack of input on that vehicle. Sween, if you drive the Q50, I'd be very interested in your input since you are a current G owner, as I recall.

Drive it like you live."
383,sweendogy,September 2013,"Mark- have you read any other article on the car? The few I've read and watch are actually glowing, you mentioned the c&d one which I guess was about the hybrid. For those of us looking at a SUb 50 sports sedan would not consider a hybrid. Sure tesla has done it right; but what other hybrid is a real all around Lux sport sedan and at a price point of 50k, which I think is redik .

On the g and a test drive, look I would love to drive the new one but I honestly can't think of replacing my car as its an 07x that has 36k miles on it- all driven by me. Just got an oil change and swaped the battery- the low maintence $$ is huge, my usage tax which was 1500 when I bought it is under 150- and most of all it's still a car that can hold its own with cars from today. The q for me would be on a very short list, always liked the lex and the 335- but I can't see being a guy who goes to dealerships and not truly looking to buy a car- not me - better ways of using my time - like driving fast and taking chances"
384,andres3,September 2013,"I test drove the car, admittedly a sample of 1.

It was brand new of course, but it seemed like the computer wouldn't give me more than 205 HP even though I floored the son of a gun as I wasn't getting the OOMPH I was looking for. The 305 horses were being lazy, or the 8 speed auto was slushing the power drastically.

Either that, or I got a ""lemon"" 350 F Sport for my test drive.

Even with a better engine, the car just didn't do enough for me handling/drive wise.

I'm spoiled by a dual clutch auto-manual transmission. I can't see ever going back. Once you go DSG, you are stuck.

How can you compare 5 different cars side by side , without driving all side by side. You can't. 15 mins can get you comfortable with a car for sure"
388,markcincinnati,September 2013,"I drove the Q50S AWD recently. Loved it. The article from C&D, while disappointing, wouldn't change my mind. I was and continue to lament the apparent lack of marketing savvy Infiniti has demonstrated regarding the Q50 -- but I will wait (for another year) to see how Infiniti does under the watchful and experienced eye and hand of Johan (as we know -- 19+ years at the helm of Audi of America, who does a great job, typically of marketing across traditional and non-traditional media).

Because my wife and I have (thus far) kept to 3-year leases (and we drive over 18K miles per year), it seems -- almost literally -- that one or the other of us is always shopping for a replacement car as one or the other is coming off lease. Hence, we do tend to test drive, as noted at least 10 times per year. I completely understand if you are NOT in the market, not wanting to test drive. Conversely, as an ""enthusiast"" I would understand if someone test drove -- on the pro-am circuit -- 24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak.

Posting here (and on Audiworld, for instance) gets our (my) interest up, so I am in the camp that favors staying ""on the hunt."" Potato, Potaato, kind of a thing.

Last night, got to drive a loaded IS 350 F Sport.

First impression (for the price) - better than the Q50S.
First impression (price be damned) - still better than the Q50S

Felt tighter, more connected -- heck, it felt like a go-kart it was so connected to the road. Turn-in was sharper than a Ken Onion Shun chef's knife -- I am sure I could get used to it, but in Sport+ mode the thing DARTED with only small steering wheel inputs.

Felt ""as if"" it were electric, the power was so quick and smooth. I only got it to about 65 MPH.

Great sound system, fantastic seats (almost Audi good, in fact.)

Not so sure why the pros say the dash is the first premium offering from any manufacturer to better an Audi interior. Interior was nice, but seemed like looking at a staircase instead of a flowing piece cut from a single piece.

I'd put it on the list -- cause at $49K (including shipping), this seems to be a better bang for the buck than either the A4 Sline or the Q50S.

I've asked for a second, long, test drive -- we'll see if it holds up to further inspection.

Drive it like you live.

389,sweendogy,September 2013,"""24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak""

Who has that kind of time- even if you were in the market -24 times - that's crazy. Dealers must love you - yeah love the car- have to wait a year still have 23 more test drives to make sure this is the one. You and flight should car pool to these dealerships."

Being in Cincinnati, I'm sure that the Q50 was AWD, right? How about the IS350? RWD or AWD?

391,markcincinnati,September 2013,"We test about 10 cars per year, escalating, sometimes to 12 or 13 -- I never said we test drive 24 times annually (although we have friends who are well heeled who seem to get a new car every spring whether they need one or not -- meaning they test a LOT.)

Dealers -- from our experience with premium brands, that is -- do seem to ""love"" having their cars test driven. The Chrysler/Jeep dealer (on the other hand) asks ""if you're going to buy today"" and if you don't give the answer they obviously want, well, ""see ya!""

Friend of ours used to work at Circuit City (remember them?) and he told me that he had two-minutes to spend with a customer and if there wasn't a clear indication that the person was going to buy TODAY, their mantra was ""who's next?"" Seems like the domestic auto dealers (Cadillac excluded) all have this ""2 minute mindset"" too.

My wife ordered her new Audi (delivery estimated at ~75-90 days) last week from a salesrep that has seen her smiling face numerous times over the last year (and we've test driven everything but an R8 and an A8) -- talk about the patience of Job. But, in the end she chose the $51K Audi over similarly priced BMWs, Volvos, Infinitis and Mercedes.

One point is (or could be) -- ""no one buys a car without driving it"" (according to the rep), so the more ""drives"" the reps have going on, the more likely it is they'll have sales; it is a numbers game, even for Premium Autos or perhaps especially for the premium autos, apparently.

Another point is (and often is) -- folks, Baby Boomers especially (not so much Millenials) like or love cars, like or love talking about them, blogging about them and driving them; so for some (especially like my wife) test driving serves a secondary purpose -- it's entertaining!

The only time I wasn't entertained was when we took out a new Lincoln -- couldn't get back to the dealership fast enough.

Drive it . . . you know . . ."
392,markcincinnati,September 2013,"Hell, the Infiniti dealer told me they have zero, zip, nada plans to even STOCK RWD Q50's -- dealer trade or special order only for the RWD versions; so, yep, we test drove a Q50S/AWD with every option except the TECH Package (the package with the blind spot monitoring system). The AWD factoid should come as no shock especially since the 10th largest BMW store's sales manager told me ""well over 50%"" of the cars they sell are X-drive

Regarding BSM, it seems like so many brands offer Blind Spot Monitoring systems as a stand alone option (usually around $500-$600) -- Infiniti bundles it an a $3,000+ package of electronic nannies. Much as I like the Q50S AWD, I wouldn't get any new car without Blind Spot Monitoring, and I don't want my new car -- yet, if ever -- to be able to drive itself and fight me whenever I try.

So, the Q50S AWD is [probably] off the table -- but I can be bought.

The Lexus IS offers BSM for relatively cheap (like Audi and Volvo, to name two) -- so score another point for the IS (but the Audi offers it stand alone too, don't you know).

The IS 350 F Sport I drove was RWD -- the only one in Cincinnati (the only F Sport so they claim). I have already signed up to test the first AWD version of an IS 350 F Sport once they come in. I didn't even bother to get into a regular IS 350 AWD -- although IS's overall seem plentiful (it's just the F Sports that are in short supply -- which was blamed on the dealer's procurement mgr; he/they didn't think Lexus customers would clamor for the SPORT version of anything -- being that it is Lexus -- ""a sofa on wheels"" -- after all).

There's a new sheriff in town -- and his/her badge has a stylized ""L"" on it (look out BMW).

394,andres3,September 2013,"I found the IS 350 RWD F-Sport I drove to be a bit more cramped inside than an A4/S4. Both less leg room, less width, and a lower roof line. Roof line matters to me a lot, I'm 6'3"" tall, and I'm not skinny anymore.

Granted, it was close, but it seemed the S4 was just a notch roomier in every way.

I didn't notice much if any difference when switching between Sport, Sport + and comfort/regular. I did notice a bigger difference in a pre-owned 2011 S4 when I was playing with comfort vs. dynamic.

I have to admit I preferred the steering weight and feeling in the '11 S4 and '09 335i I test drove over the '13 S4, which still felt better and more weighted than all others. I guess in recent years everyone has gone with electric steering for efficiency. It didn't change the mileage rating on the S4 so it must be .4 miles or less better per gallon.

Funny you mention that, was at the BMW dealer Wed night, drove a 320i, since BMW is giving 2,500K credit, towards purchasing a 2013 3 series. People criticize the 320i, but as a occasional driver it's not a bad car, Premium package, Sport package is $39,950, costco auto program $36,750 so far give price of $35,900 plus tax and lic. This does not include the $2500. I'm going with the BMW Select Financing, don't know if I'm going with the 48 or 60 month. I was told BMW has a special rate with the 48 months, but the sale manager has to get back with me.

While at the dealership, they have two 3 series GT's, have to say, lots of room in it much more so then what I figured, they also have 4 328d's, didn't drive one, I might tomorrow just to see what it drives like.

Sweeny, it's nice to sit at home and read car magazines and bench talk about cars, however, getting out and test driving them is a whole different story, as Mark stated, the Germans want to go for a test drive, what i found is, they want a stat a relationship with the client, something that the domestic dealers lack and asians. Once you are in the fiance office it's NEXT. The guy I deal with at BMW knows me, he knows I'll buy again, and I am. If I bought a ford, I doubt that same sales person would be at the same dealer 6 months from now."
397,markcincinnati,September 2013,"I can't remember if the ""cause"" is local or if all BMW dealers do what is done at one of the dealerships here in River City: About once a year (it could be more) I get an invitation in the mail, followed up with a voice mail message inviting my wife and me to test drive as many BMW's as we want (all in a single day).

As I recall, the dealership has a huge grill that they keep fired up cooking brats, metts and hamburgers. They have veggies, cookies, sodas, bottled water and (in the dealership) a Starbucks - lite. All the food and other things offered (a goodies bag) are no-charge.

What they are doing, I assume, is pimping their cars in the most subtle way possible. They tell you that for every car you drive and every mile you drive it, they will make a donation to the [breast] Cancer society (something like that.) And, after you have taken so many cars out you get a little sticker or pin that proclaims you helped raise money for the cure.

Naturally when there is free food and drink and cool cars to drive, the place is packed. My wife and I drove an X6 (she had an X3 at the time) and she loved it (conceptually). Now she didn't buy one, but of all the cars we drove that day, the ruby red metallic X6 was the subject of a number of subsequent conversations.

Altruism? I'll go so far as to say ""possibly"" since there was money raised for a good cause. Yet, the buzz generated by this ""forced"" test driving has to be worth a lot of TV ads and other marketing expenses -- don't you think?

And, we actually got to drive some pretty cool cars (there was no M5 in inventory, however), eat some good burgers, mingle with a bunch of other BMW (or perhaps just premium car) geeks and raise money for a good cause. Seems like a great idea -- get folks to drive ""everything"" pump them up, ""don't forget to breathe"" signs were hung everywhere -- it was a blast.

The point is, if you like these premium cars and you blog about them, belong to and participate in forums about them -- you might just be like the characters on ""The Big Bang"" who are always playing D&D, shopping for comic books and buying memorabilia -- even though they are PhD's working for a prestigious university.

I would guess many of us here posting are closet (or maybe we have come out of said closet) car geeks -- we drink our coffee out of fill-in-the-blank logo'd coffee cups (in my case Audi, in my wife's case BMW), we have ""expensive"" logo'd polo shirts, jackets and key fobs proclaiming our affinity for our favorite brand (lots of BMW jackets here in Cincinnapolis, for example) and so forth.

To this day, Audi sends me expensive brochures and from time to time a hardcopy book (25 years of quattro, kind of thing); but, to be fair, so does Lincoln, even though we only took a short test drive of one of them and couldn't get out of it fast enough the test drive was so bad.

Ahhh, its the weekend -- and we're on the hunt for a replacement for my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD. My wife says we're testing a new ATS (already tested the CTS -- not the 2014 -- and found it wanting) and a new A4 or S4 or both. I recently drove an A6 with the 220HP four cylinder, and I thought it was pretty sweet, maybe we'll do that too -- with the sport suspension if possible.

What a great time to be in the market.

404,robr2,September 2013,"...just a tib bit, before a participant could do the 3 day walk, they HAD to raise a min of $2500...

Many fundraising events like the 3 Day have minimum commitments for fundraising. Here in MA, there is a biking event called the Pan Mass Challenge which raises money for the Jimmy Fund at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. It's a two day 110 mile ride and one must raise or commit to paying $4300 to participate - it goes to $5000 if you register late (there are shorter rides with lower fund raising commitments). They were the first charity event to have participants give them a credit card at registration. The founder isn't shy about it - trying to raise the amount isn't good enough.

Yet they get 5000 people regularly and have a goal of $38 million this year.

Part of having a minimum amount is to make sure participants are committed. It's a logistical nightmare to coordinate support for 5000 people over 110 miles. If people sign up and then drop out, they have too many resources. If too many people raise too little money, then the event might not make money."

On the other hand -- if Infiniti continues its practice of seriously subventing leases [on the Q50] -- the Q50 so priced per month, could be a value buy. The thing is the Q50 is still in the league that it is being compared with (and losing.)

I drove it (the Q), and yes I liked the IS more, but for a $120/month differential for 36 months with no money down, the Q50 could prove to be a good seller, good value, and selling well enough to allow the '15 or '16 to work out some of the complaints presented by the pros and amateurs (like us).

In any case, as I have said previously, Johan has his work cut out for him. Better tackle the M sooner rather than later, too. Of course only changing the name of the FX to QX70 seems a invite a sales slow-down there, too.

With the G37 filling the low-mid-30k range, I'm willing to bet that finding a Q50 for less than $40k will be virtually impossible! They'lll market the Q50 as as a step (or half-step) above the G37...

Meanwhile, with the revised pricing, the 2014 G37 is a heck of a value despite being one of the oldest designs in the segment.

I don't see Inifiniti given the market cachet of BMW, Audi, or MB. If the market thought they were as good they could be as high priced. Companies don't leave cash on the table for altruistic reasons.

Infiniti is sort of like the sport version of Lexus. Lexus is a boring reliable luxury make (although trying to break into sport). Infiniti is a reliable sporty make trying to get to where the leaders are. The G series is a bargain if you like pure sport almost as good as BMW but growlier engines and interiors not as nice as MB or Audi. They're sort of like the promising upstart teenager with loads of potential, but not all that refined yet.

428,andys120,September 2013,"Been there doing that (sorta)- back in '04 I bought a used '00 BMW 528iA and paid about what a loaded new Camry would cost. I still have it over 100k miles later and have had very few major repairs. In fact I've had such good luck that I recently bought a '01 BMW 330Ci Cabrio which is also giving me great service.

-IMO a 3-4 y/o car hits the sweet spot in the depreciation curve and most haven't got many miles on and so are good for many more. There are exceptions (like my 11 y/o 330ciC).

-Do your homework, check the car out thoroughly including PPI and you should do fine.

-As for extended warranties those are a crap shoot. I found out they're written by Philadelphia lawyers with degrees in Automotive Engineering.
I found out when the VANOS module failed that it was not a ""covered component"" and was out $1500. OTOH they did cover the airbag module
($900).

We won't have the 6-vehicle limit there, and the software also has much more ""search-friendly"" features. Unless something is critically broken on this platform, it's not going to get attention for the time being.

While the main site is being redesigned, our forums move is totally separate from that - the timing is just coincidental. We just couldn't live with all of the bugs, outages and slowness (not to mention the lack of basic features like private messaging and easy image upload), and we got the go-ahead from Edmunds to find a new vendor.

448,markcincinnati,September 2013,"Although I had read the R&T comparison on-line, my physical magazine arrived in the mail yesterday (Monday 9/23) -- and I re-read the Q50 v ATS v 335 v IS 350 F-Sport article. I assume you could infer that I am carrying Infiniti's water, but the article did make a comment that even the loser (or 3rd finisher) in the bunch was a ""nice car.""

For those of you who think the Q50 isn't really an upgrade of the G37 -- and assuming you haven't seen one in person, or haven't gotten behind the wheel and haven't driven it -- the Q50 has a seriously upscale (non-Nissan) interior, an exterior that advances the theme (even if you don't like it or aren't drawn to it, it does show more than just a slightly evolutionary change).

Yes the engine of the new Q50 is the same as the outgoing engine (and transmission); but, somehow the Q50 at full cry compared with the G37 under similar circumstances, sounds and feels several steps more refined, less harsh, less ""thrashy.""

All the tech stuff -- that seems to be universally dissed -- is part of a package that you need not order. Unfortunately, all the apparently loathed tech: self-driving, pseudo-psychic stuff has to be selected (and endured) to get blind spot monitoring.

A nice long test drive in a new Q50S/AWD reveals it to be a major update in luxury and performance. Your decision to consider these updates as improvements is, well, YOUR decision.

I had thought, at MSRP, the Q50 could possibly be the new winna and champeen sports sedan -- when compared to the 4-cylinder Audi A4, BMW 3 series and Cadillac ATS. I can now count at least five (5) negative articles (3 of them comparison articles) about the new Q50 in ""major"" car enthusiasts' magazines. One negative, no problem, two negatives, ""I can explain,"" but five articles that deride the lack of a solid steering column or reveal the Q50 to come in fourth (out of four) or second (out of two) and so on, are gonna require some heavy 'splainin' or some major sub-venting whilst Infiniti's designers and engineers apply numerous PTF's, service packs and point-releases in an effort to shore up the car's shortcomings and earn it the right to ask for a ""re-do"" review and comparison.

I wouldn't be shocked if an all tricked out Q50S/AWD is offered thusly: Buy one, get one free!

Well, OK, maybe that is unlikely.

Meanwhile, holy cow, Car and Driver and Road and Track BOTH proclaim an IS 350 the winna and champeen over a BMW 335! And, comparably equipped the 335 is likely to cost five-figures more than the IS. Get your IS while they're hot!

Perhaps, however, the Cadillac ATS is an even more significant ""loser"" as it keeps coming up short despite a best ever chassis.

I thought it was particularly damning that the R&T article commented that the 3.6L six in the ATS was the same engine (virtually if not quite literally) as is used to motivate the new Impala.

The American and Japanese mfgrs, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus, need to bring out either super or turbo charged 4's and 6's -- ASAP! Frankly, I was damn near stunned that the 335's engine couldn't seal the deal -- proclaiming the Lexus engine as the second best engine was impressive considering its age.

Test driving note:

Until last Thursday, the Audi A7 3.0T was one of the best (if not the best) cars I have ever driven. The supercharged engine coupled with that 8-speed transmission coupled with the feel of the car at high speeds coupled with the way it took corners all came together in a car that was attainable without robbing a bank.

Last Thursday, my Audi dealer called to offer me a test drive of a new 2014 S4 with the 7-speed DSG transmission. The S4 tester had the upgraded leather seats, the ""pin-stripe"" black wood trim, B&O sound system and an Audi Exclusive blue pearl paint (at a breathtaking price), to name other ""available"" options. It was just south of $59,000 (less than an A7 by far.)

Again, with the qualification that this car is ""attainable"" by mere mortals (if they are upper-middle class, that is), I would say the S4 is sublime, the best ever I have ever . . . . :surprise:

The transmission is practically telepathic or perhaps to put a finer point on it, the transmission is a mind-reader. Holy cow, please (who ever I can plead my case to) make this 7-speed DSG transmission an option on EVERYTHING you build.

As it is very easy to get a BMW 335 to the ""upper fifties"" and as the current trend seems to be to compare the 335 to the ATS, the Q50 and of course the IS, it would seem a five-way comparison wherein an S4 was included (perhaps without the high-zoot leather and big-buck paint job and the most expensive dash trim) would be a no brainer. After all, an S4 can be easily configured -- and desirable -- and still be in the lower fifties.

It wouldn't surprise me if the S4 bettered both the 335 and the IS 350.

As Cheech and Chong once said, ""I saw god, man!""

The S4 -- with the MSRP qualification -- is currently my favorite car (of any car that I and other mere mortals could afford).

We're, er, I'm not worthy.

DILYL."
449,andres3,September 2013,"Your findings on the S4 are the same as mine. Which is why I ordered one lightly optioned and got the dealer to agree to take only 50K out of my bank accounts (don't worry, CA will take about 5K more before it's all said and done.

Should be arriving at my location 2nd week of November or so.

The Q50 would be better with the S4's brakes, drive train (engine & transmission) for sure!

So would the IS 350. So would the ATS. So would the 335i.

I'm picking the supercharged Audi 3.0L V6 all day and night, and all the other manufacturers really need to pay Audi to buy rights to use the 7-speed DSG in their own automatics.

In my view, once you go DSG, you never go back. The other automatics are not competitive at all in my opinion; even with 8 gears.

I hear BMW has a good dual clutch in the M-series, but that isn't in the $50K ball park.

450,graphicguy,September 2013,"Mark...you'll get not rebuttal from me regarding the S4. Drop the ""pearlescent"" paint, the hi-zoot seats, and the ""whatzatstuff"" trim, and you should be able to make a case for a low $50-ish check with your dealer (but you'll probably have to go to Beechmont Audi to make that score).

S4 w/Premium Plus, B&O stereo, DSG should get you to that ballpark.

Now, if they could just make it so they can keep it out of its 2nd home in the dealer's service bay..........

I read the same rags as you. Never could understand why they don't include an S4 in those Sport/Lux comparisons. I can't see how it would lose against the usual suspects.

That 3.0 S/C motor is under rated by Audi. the BMW 3.0L dual scroll turbo is really good. The Audi 3.0 S/C is better. Torque can be found everywhere. And, the DSG is the best transmission I've ever used....on any car, at any price. Ride, handling...superb. The S4 steering should make BMW uber jealous.

I saw the CLA in the showroom and the interior is clearly not the same as E class and probably on par in size with the 1.8t.

A deep well of torque awaits your command with zero lag -- whoosh, it is like upgrading your iPhone 5 to the new operating system and watching your email client make the jump to light speed.

Here is my regret -- the difference between the 2.0T and the 3.0T ""A"" and ""S"" 4 is a chasm a giant, deep and wide chasm. The A4 needs to be offered with the 3.0T engine as it is offered in the Q5 3.0T. Also, for some price, the DSG transmission ought to be offered on the 2.0T, the milder 3.0T and the wilder 3.0T (as it is already there).

Were Audi to offer the 8-speed tip and the 7-speed DSG across the board (of three engines), I would look forward to win after win after win for these sport ,sedans: the A4, the AS4 and the S4. Nice as the new IS 350 F Sport is, I would expect the AS4 and with absolute certainly the S4 to be seeing the IS's LED's in its rearview mirror.

And, for the money -- in this league -- the S4 and the 335 would be competitive (with each other, at least). Of course the IS and even the ATS can certainly be considered the value leaders; yet, the Q50/S is already so highly subvented (and it is likely to remain thus until its issues are behind it) that even with its faults is an attractive alternative for those who want an upscale high content premium car.

A friend of mine used to say Audi's are for the left-brainers and BMW's are for the right-brainers -- meaning that ""programmers"" drove Audis and the Vice-president of Sales drove BMWs. I think now the Q50 has become the ""programmers"" [geek squad] car and, well, these days ""everyone wants to be Audi.""

Treat yourself -- take a nice long test drive in a 2014 S4 with the DSG transmission -- you may be worthy. Me? I'm still not worthy -- but I'm working on it.

463,graphicguy,September 2013,"335i vs S4. Have owned both. S4 wins.

I've test driven Benzs in the past. Almost pulled the trigger on a c350 4 matic coupe that the (then) GF wanted. I agree. For that money, you can get an S5.

I also looked at a C300 before I bought the 335i. Once again, I could never see the MB being able to match, let alone exceed, the drive of the BMW for the same money.

CLA is a lesser version of all those cars, even in AMG guise.

Personally, I'd test drive the S4. As others have said, that's what will hook you. I'd also look at the IS350, for no other reason than all the positive press it has received, just to see if it fits what you're looking for.

464,markcincinnati,September 2013,"The CLA has been the cause of a decent amount of journalistic drool for months and months and months. The tarted up version has caused some who write about cars and get paid for doing so to be unabashedly aroused, in fact.

Check out the comments about the upcoming A3 -- I don't have them right in front of me, but the gist is something like ""the new A3 is everything we all wanted the CLA to be -- and there is an S3 version coming shortly after the A3 quattro hits showrooms next year.""

Can't believe I'm saying this: IMHO, BMW -- a brand that I love AND think is breathtakingly expensive -- looks like a bargain compared to any Mercedes I can think of. Would love to see an S4 reviewed side by side with a comparably PRICED Mercedes.

The S4 would be high contented compared to the Merc and the S4 would make the worthy opposition sweat.

Me? Again, I am looking for content and performance and bang for the buck. Hate to say it, but the IS 350 F-Sport makes a compelling case (when compared to even the god-like S4).

You know, all the criticism about Infiniti and Lexus bringing out new cars with ""old"" engines does have merit. But, even so, the IS 350 seems to win the pros over in spite of its ""old"" engine. I get sweaty palms just imagining what would happen if Lexus told its engineers to make the requisite changes to the 350's powerplant to allow it to accept either a super or turbo charger. :surprise:

That said, there are those who love the styling of the CLA...especially given its 3/4 of a CLS type of view.

NY....I'm trying hard to like the Q50. Granted, I haven't driven one, yet. But, I'm not even luke warm about the styling. Now, that they've softened it up (as all the trade rags state), I can't find a reason to visit an Infiniti showroom....maybe as a curiosity, but little more.

All of that is personal preference, however. I'm sure Infiniti will be OK, as will Mercedes. As much as the CLA trails its competition in the performance dept, they'll sell every one they can get their hands on because it has a Mercedes logo on the front.

473,Michaell,October 2013,"gg - with your past experience with the 335i and S4, I suspect the only iteration of the CLA that will interest you is the CLA 45 - the AMG version with the 355HP 4-cylinder.

What I've read about that car is that it's a real rocket, perhaps a competitor for the S4.

But, isn't Audi refreshing the A3 to be a sedan only, and that a 300 HP S3 will be available down the road?

Not sure that you can order a CLA with the same options; if you could, I'm sure you'd quickly find yourself in the mid to high 30's for price.

Some may choose to spend the extra $$$ to get the options they want; others may walk out frustrated.

I suppose it's managed risk on the part of the manufacturers to capture the former at the risk of losing the latter.

I find it interesting that only BMW covers maintenance for the first 4 years / 50K miles. If I were comparing at 320i against the CLA that would certainly factor into my decision.

Or, will many customers go the way of nyc, who leased his BMW but is now considering a Honda as his next car?

I'm trying to get the wife on board with a low-cost lease of a 3rd car we could share. She's got a Mazda CX-7 with almost 40K on the clock as her DD, and I've got an '06 ION with 96K that I'll keep as a winter car and part-time pizza delivery vehicle.

I'd like to find a lease in the $300-350/mo range of something that gets better mileage than the CX-7 (20-21 in mixed use) and is fun to drive. The CLA and 320i both fit the bill, I think. I looked at the Lexus CT200h last weekend; it's pretty nice inside and 40MPG is outstanding, but not sure it would provide the 'fun' I'm looking for.

The maintenance costs of the BMW over 3 years would be $0; not sure what they'd be for the CLA.

Except of course for tires ($1000+ for RFTs every 2 years), alignments ($120-$200 every year or so) and some other stuff pushy ""service advisors"" would try to sell. Well, that of course depends on the actual tire, there may be some cheaper ones and alignment is not mandatory, but probably well-advised.

Once she had it down to the Q5, it was a matter of ""which engine?""

We drove the slightly HP (+9) up-rated 2014 2.0T with the 8-spd tiptronic; then the 3.0T also with the 8-spd (of course, since that is all that is offered) then the 2.0T and so on.

I decided I really liked the ""detuned"" S4 engine enough to rule out even an all sported up A4 2.0T S-Line -- meaning a new IS 350 F Sport AWD was the only way to go. At the time, I knew I was not worthy of an S4 -- and besides, they were in a whole 'nother price class.

So, I configured the IS, got a ""no strings attached"" order placed (apparently none exist with the uprated sound system -- they have to be ordered?!) :confuse: And was prepped to wait 120 days. Mean time back in Audi-ville, the new 3.0T Q5 production reports started coming in -- we even got the arrival date and got the Audi dealer to take the 2011 Infiniti FX35 off of my wife's hands about 5 months ahead of the lease termination.

The Audi dealer is a sweet-heart (due to our lengthy history with Audi and the dealership) and a couple of weeks ago, the sales rep sent me an email offering test drives of an A5 2.0T (with sport suspension) and an S-Tronic S4 (which I had already tested and was smitten by).

To make a long story short, my membership in the Audi Club got me an immediate 6% off of the sticker of a new Audi and *BONUS* got my wife a $1,000 loyalty bonus on her inbound 3.0T Q5.

It was like watching the Exorcist 128 times in a row -- ""It got better and better every time.""

So, I said, get me a new S4 in Ibis white (a no charge paint color) and nav and B&O and blind spot monitoring and I'm there.

No wait.

Get me one, like the above but with the Magma Red Leather interior and carbon fiber inlays.

There's one in the US (in NY) and none on a boat. Never mind, I'll order one.

Days later -- email dings: The NY car is yours.

It is being trucked from NY to Cincinnati practically as we speak.

Hmm an S4 vs an IS 350 F Sport? The S-Tronic transmission (DSG) is worth the price of admission and the supercharged engine is, well, incredible and, all things considered, economical. Put the thing in dynamic mode and it is a four-door hot rod. Keep it in comfort mode and it is just south of a full-on LPS.

Funny thing, the S4 S-Tronic has paddle shifters but the car is smarter than most people (like me), so you're better off leaving the S-Tronic to its own devices. The 8-speed tiptronic, however, only comes with paddle shifters if you get the sport interior (which is rare), and the 8-speed benefits from them.

Here's one that puzzles me: why not market an A4 with the same engine as the Q5 3.0T (a detuned S4 supercharged affair good for 295 ft pounds of torque)?

I haven't had a speeding ticket in almost 20 years -- gulp! The S4 could easily break that streak.

I think you enjoyed it, but there's nothing like going back to the mother ship, apparently.

You and a number of ther people on these boards have gone through 4-6 cars in the time it's taken me to live with two. The second/current is an Acura TSX, and it's not given me a bit of trouble, beyond the fact that the damn driver's door wants to close itself far too easily. That's the sum total of my complaint (singular) in 5.5 years and 80K miles of driving. It drives the wrong pair of wheels, but has a delightful manual transmission and a suspension that was developed for the rest of the world, so I'm very pleased overall.

You can now continue bumping up the number of Audis you've been in possession of over the years. Sounds like your wife has returned to the fold also.

Do 100% agree on the magma red interior being the best, I got mine ordered with the Misano Red exterior to go with it. I'm no longer afraid of cops; I'm too old and too wise; but they still waste my time with court appearances.

515,flightnurse,October 2013,"First off, congrats Mark on the new purchase's.. One question, I was not aware that you can get any other color interior than black with the sport package, every time I built an Audi on line and choose the sport back, the interior would default to black glad to know this isn't the case, Rick has been looking at a Q5 on line..

Now, talking about new cars.... A couple of weeks back I had started talking with the BMW dealer about a purchase of a 320i. Then Rick and I took off for New England and NYC for a week, on my return we continued to talk more, so Friday, I went to the dealership and finalized the deal. It is Jet Black, Beige Leather with Premium Package, 8spd auto. I made out pretty good, 2K built Credit, 750 returning BMW owner, 500 USAA , and 1K graduate money. I used the Costco purchase agreement, which gave me the car $750 over invoice, when it was all said and done, OTD price was $35,275. I took the BMW select financing for 4 years. It was nice to walk out with zero out of pocket. I didn't want to lease the car as my payment would have been higher, and Rick would be using the car while I'm at work.

Drove the car up to Sedona that evening, on this trip up and back averaged 33.6 not bad for a car with 47 miles when starting off. Speed was between 55 to 90, the higher speed was not intentional the car doesn't feel the speed as in my past BMWs. I wish I had the BMW Assist but over on BimmerFest it seem that it can be added to the car.

I have to say, I really like the car, yes, it has elec steering, but the only time you really know it is when you really push the car, and on city streets one doesn't get to that limit. So far I like the 8 spd auto, when in sport mode, the car up shift quickly and down shift just as fast. Now it just to learn all of the fun things that iDrive does..."

519,markcincinnati,October 2013,"Both my wife's Q5 and my S4 came (or will come) from Greg @ the Audi Connection. My wife's 2011 FX35 also came from another Joseph dealership, Infiniti of Cincinnati.

Dealing with these folks has always been a pleasure -- and the Audi Club membership helped with the price (on the S4). Service departments at both Audi and Infiniti have been great, too.

We went ahead and got the Audi Care mntce programs -- something missed on both the Acura and the Infiniti. The premium cars we have had experience with are always very pricey to maintain -- even the Infiniti. On the other hand, the service departments at Acura, Audi, BMW and Infiniti have always been delightful in terms of giving customers the red carpet treatment.

We bought the Q5 and leased the S4. Don't laugh, but we have NEVER purchased a car -- it is scary, since we have always felt that houses should be purchased and cars should be rented.

Those folks who have never leased, probably don't get why we have some fear and trepidation about buying. I guess it is like getting married vs living together. Buying seems like a commitment, leasing not so much. Cars however are transitory, ephemeral -- so, to us buying is a scary proposition.

Now the Q5, based on its anticipated depreciation, is not as much of a financial risk as many cars are.

We'll let you know how this venture into this new experience works out.

522,billyperksii,October 2013,"Mark I have to ask you this (not that I am getting personal), but dont you have around 18 months left on your TL lease?
Are you that unsatisfied with the car that you are willing to eat those 18 months of payments?

Secondly, I disagree with your concepts of leasing/buying cars, I will not get into the nuts and bolts of it- I just disagree."
523,markcincinnati,October 2013,"The situation with the TL is that I have 10 months left on the lease. At the lease's conclusion, my mileage situation means I would owe about $5,000 to walk away from Acura. Acura, unlike Infiniti, doesn't allow you to buy miles at lease inception at a discount. My wife bought 18K miles per year on her lease, I couldn't do that.

My TL is an SH-AWD advance -- and, after detailing it last week, it looks nearly new. Using three web-sites, plus CarFAX, I was able to determine that to abandon my lease will cost less than $2K today.

So I am going to be ding'd -- a little now vs a lot then. My plan, at this point is to consider buying the S4 off lease (I will have first right of refusal) with a CPO warranty and Audi Care to 100,000 miles. Audi does allow the purchase of additional miles after lease inception, but before the last 6 months of the lease.

As noted, we're thinking buying should not be completely discounted -- so we're taking the buy one rent one (and possibly buy later) approach since we've no experience with buying a car and find the concept almost foreign.

So, yep terminating the lease early will cost me, but not nearly as much as going to full term.

Your mileage may differ.

I will probably join the Audi Band Wagon in a couple of years... maybe sooner."
529,markcincinnati,October 2013,"The Audi Prestige and Acura Advance pose at least one question I intellectually understand but ""just don't seem right!""

The Prestige and Advance ""configurations"" from Audi and Acura seem to me to be a way to bundle virtually ""everything"" into one package. Indeed, the Acura Advance has no options that can be had, the Advance (over the technology package version) adds 19"" wheels, heated and ventilated seats and blind spot monitoring.

The Prestige Audi adds a number of extras (on top of the next lower configuration, Premium+) and seems to offer the buyer a slightly better deal when purchased as part of the Prestige package. Although in the case of Audi, it is possible to add most of the Prestige features (for extra cost, of course) to the Premium+. In other words, if you wanted blind spot monitoring, you can tick off that option on a Premium+ version for $500 and NOT get the navigation system which comes standard with the Prestige version.

OK, now that I have tap danced around your question, I'll mention that the top of the line configurations have lower residuals than the ""middle children.""

We configured my wife's Q5 and my S4 by building up Premium+ models to have most of the Prestige's features which actually means that our residual % on Premium+ is higher than the maxed out contented Prestige models.

You may wonder why we researched the residual of the Q5 since we are buying it -- but the reason to know the residual has to do with knowing at least the possible value of the depreciating asset at various times during the financing contract. In other words, knowing the ""residual"" does allow us to have an understanding of when the car is no longer upside down. With the S4, the residual is important for obvious reasons, since it is leased. The S4 P+ has an attractive residual indeed which is, of course, a double edged sword.

The higher residual lowers the mo/pay but also raises the cost of buying the car off lease should we decide to go that route.

Now to answer your question:

My 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance has a % residual $ amt = $24,509.85.

The MSRP was = $47,166.30. ~52% residual in other words.

Just read an article from one of the trade rags about the new CTS. Apparently, it's quite a nice car. But, the one they tested had the 3.6L V6 (same as in the Impala, I believe). And, all loaded up, it will kick open the $60K door.

While I've only seen pics, and just read about it, $60K+??????? I thought that price point was reserved for the blinged out Escalades. I'm still trying to justify 4 cyl (albeit tubo) BMW 3s for $50K.

I've also just read where Volvo is dumping all of its 5 cyl and 6 cyl engines starting in '15.

Will withhold judgement until I get some hands on experience, but I'm not liking this trend.

2014 S4 S-tronic (by default the car is a Premium+ model)

B&O radio/speaker upgrade
MMI (etc etc etc)
UHP All-season tires (18"" wheels, 245/40)

Apparently Audi Drive Select (light) is now included on Premium+ models; the missing feature is the adjustable shocks. Maybe that is what is worth nearly $3,000 -- having had this feature on my 2009 A4, I would say it would be worth perhaps half that amount going forward. The S4 suspension, however, seems to have struck a good balance between dynamic and comfort, so color me happy.

It currently has 46 miles on it, is parked in the garage as I am sick as a dog with a nasty cold.

Got the 6% discount by virtue of being a member of the Audi Club of North America -- and as an additional bonus, when my wife's Q5 comes in next month, she will get a $1,000 loyalty bonus in addition to the discount offered by the dealer (which on the Q5 is more than 6%, meaning the ACNA program couldn't help us there.)

QND observation: My last two Audis were a 2005 A6 followed by a 2009 A4 -- the S4 dash and controls are little changed from those two cars (which is more than fine by me). However, the S4 MMI seems to have transformed the car almost into a computer, there are so many features and functions that are controlled by the MMI.

I like the idea of adjustable shocks in theory, but I wonder if that would add additional weight to the car rather than just letting Audi Engineers pick one perfect balanced refined setting and sticking to that.

Also, paying extra on a car that's already 50K (and more) scared me.
I'd like the supercharged badges too, rather than the misnomer of V6T decals on the side, but they are about $150 extra bucks. The buck has to stop somewhere.

Like I said, if I was CEO of Audi I'd of made the differential and supercharged badges standard equipment.

Good for Audi in making this a single option rather than attempting to bury it along with thousands of dollars worth of other features (like the Infiniti Q50)."
545,andres3,October 2013,"Agreed; Audi allows you to pick ala cart items from the ""PRESTIGE"" package with the ""Premium Plus"" package, therefore making the PRESTIGE package pointless unless you like every item it includes.

Acura lost points on this count. I absolutely adore the sound system, but $3K to even 3.5K extra didn't make sense to me. Why is the good leather combined with the sound system ""tech"" package anyway? Most of that cost is in the Navigation which can be had for $100 in a portable unit.

Seriously though, the S4 is a very sweet car. Congrats!"
549,markcincinnati,October 2013,"I've now spent a bit of time ""initializing"" the S4's MMI system parameters -- including Audi Connect (free for 6-months). In terms of ease of use, the MMI user interface remains super easy, one could argue it is almost intuitive. What I do notice, this time, in comparison to my 2009 A4 Prestige, is that there seems to be more that can be configured via the MMI. I had to chuckle when I pressed the CAR button and was presented with the ability to set my INDIVIDUAL preferences and one of them pertained to the engine/exhaust sound: ""Comfort,"" ""Auto,"" or ""Dynamic."" This option must be there simply ""because they could."" I guess when your car stickers at north of $56K, you need to be able to rule your domain, so to speak.

I do appreciate the new (to me) ability to speak entire phone numbers and entire addresses without having to spell things out or use the rotary knob to dial in o-n-e l-e-t-t-e-r a-t a t-i-m-e. Big move forward in voice recognition. Pairing my iPhone 5, too, was a snap -- but, there is no easy way to use the iPhone (other than Bluetooth) since the supplied cable is only good for iPhone's up to the 4S models. That is one thing Acura did a better job of: media connectivity. I mean, you could use a USB or a mini-stereo (male) plug or Bluetooth or all three at the same time.

Audi uses its own proprietary cable and you can't have your iPhone set up for two functions: one Bluetooth and one hardwired ""connection"" are not supported. My primary reason for not using Bluetooth has been I wanted to keep the phone in charge mode while I was driving, and the Acura allowed just that by plugging one end of the cable into the iPhone and one end into a female USB which charged the iPhone and allowed both iPod and Phone functions to operate without first shutting one down to use the other.

It is a small thing -- but sometimes it just makes one wonder why they can produce such a technologically advanced vehicle but overlook what most of us have come to expect in a plug''n'-play world.

Another cool feature -- but one that is NOT worth $30/month after the 6 month free trial ends -- is Audi connect that will actually show google earth pictures on the nav screen -- in excellent clarity. Not sure why I'd pay for that. Now, I know the stated ""value"" of Audi connect is that it turns the interior of the S4 into a WiFi hotspot -- but here's the thing, the ONLY carrier offered is T-Mobile and the signal is restricted to 3G. Those of you with the outdated Apple iPhone 5 know that your phone can be made into a WiFi hot spot (and that is just a ""standard"" feature of the iPhone); but, the difference is, depending on your carrier, I suppose, the iPhone can be 4G LTE, which would make someone's laptop using your iPhone WiFi hotspot run faster. Yes, the Audi Connect is more than a WiFi hotspot enabler, but, really, if I needed a hotspot while driving, the iPhone works well and you can buy a hell of a lot of ""band"" for an extra $30 per month.

I guess I look at Audi Connect as a too expensive technology considering its data fees. If my mind changes, I'll report back to you.

OK, once you get all (or most) of the MMI options set the way YOU want them, you're ready to punch the start button and -- finally -- take this sublime machine out on the road.

I set my Audi Drive Select to dynamic and put the S-Tronic in D (which becomes ""S"" when set to dynamic via the MMI) and pulled out of the driveway.

The power that is available underfoot is hard to describe -- I am tempted to hyperventilate and gush ""the power feels limitless,"" which it does, but I won't, for I know someone, somewhere will point out a quicker, stronger and even more capable vehicle. For the life of me, though, when I read (or watch on YouTube) the test reports and see 0-60 in 4.4 seconds as the tested performance, I now understand how quickly the S4 reaches speed without muss nor fuss and without my even noticing it. Its ""pick up"" is so quick AND so smooth, it cautions me to watch the gauges since there are few signals of how quickly speed rises (and I am cautioned by the local long arm of the law, too).

Braking, too, makes me now think I understand how landing on an aircraft carrier must feel -- the brakes shed speed with incredible -- ""you've got to feel it to believe it"" -- aplomb.

My 2009 A4 was a quiet car to ride in -- not compared to the 2014 S4, though. The S4 almost makes me believe there might be some actual practical purpose to the MMI setting governing engine/exhaust sound -- you might need to hear something to clue you in just how quickly you got to extra-legal speeds. Lord knows there isn't much in the way of an audible cue to give you a sense of velocity.

Speaking of sound -- the Acura TL (Advance) has, to this day, not been bettered in terms of the sound system Acura blesses it [the TL Advance] with -- the B&O sound system in the S4 is ""cleaner and clearer"" than my fading memory of my 2009 A4 B&O. Nothing, so far, come close to the sound of a DVD-audio recording (or a DTS disc, for that matter), but the current iteration of the B&O system is a welcome improvement. The HD radio as well as SiriusXM probably sound as good as these technologies (and transmission limitations) can deliver, so I'll simply suggest checking off the B&O option box should you choose Audi from the ELLPS list.

With such green tires it is difficult to say anything about the ""handling"" of the S4 -- since it will surely improve over the next few days as the ""green-ness"" of the tires is scrubbed away. By the way, I chose (of my own free will) to get the 18"" UHP A/S tires instead of the MAX Perf Summer-only rubber. I live in Cincinnati for pity's sake -- the freeways are crowded (so what good is a 155 mph limiter?) and we do have moderate winters with a couple of days of snow cover here and there -- besides, the summer rubber Audi chooses really has a short tread life in my experience. I'll live (in shame) with a 130 mph limiter in other words.

That's it for now.

I'll close and wonder why (considering the price and the ""natural comparison"") the S4 was not thrown in the mix of cars that were compared to the new Lexus IS F Sport. I would think the S4 might have given the judges pause. We'll see, maybe next time.

550,graphicguy,October 2013,"Mark...glad you're enjoying the S4. I agree with everything you say. The Audi connect wasn't worth it to me, either. In addition, during the trial, it was painfully slow.

I leave everything in dynamic mode most of the time, except if I'm on a long interstate jaunt. I use comfort settings, then. I got the all season tires, too. I really had no use for the 155 MPH summer only tires.

I agree about the stereo, too. The B&O is good, but the TL ELS stereo is the best I've heard in any car, at any price.

As you know, it's really nice around the OH Valley right now. But, when we hit those mid 90s next summer, you'll find the A/C to be frigid.

2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
551,dino001,October 2013,"Just attended my dealer's model introduction event. Not a very good one - they simply grabed first available salesman and gave me their standard test drive. The only difference between the ""event"" and standard day at the office was they had vehicles lined up and ready, so no time lost in searching. And fancy appetizers, and small gift. Not really comparable to those manufacturer's events.

Anyway, I got a chance for first drive in 328 GT and diesel. First was 328 GT. I was prepared for much worse when it comes to GT, but it drove OK. Longer wheelbase increased the turn radius, but that's the price for room. Steering wheel feel is equally dreadful in small speeds, as one in standard 3-series, but it's not much worse. High speeds feel similar. Car is good for cruising and commute, but certainly not for track - but it was clearly not built for that. The biggest thing is BMW reportedly redesigned start/stop system, engine hardware and software. The engine is noticeably smoother and start/stop works better. Car no longer shakes at restart. This was done for all July and later production day cars.

Next was diesel, 328d. It is same as 320d in Europe, but they changed name, because americans would not pay premium for ""economy"" name. Think 320i vs 328i. 328d is more than 328i, if they called it 320d they'd sell half of those. it is clearly long distance car. Pleasant, quick enough, but not as fast even as 328i. But it doesn't need to be. I think it may be a decent offset for the fuel economy, as long as it delivers on those mpg numbers on the sticker. I'm not a diesel fanatic, but it may just be first time I see a real diesel product that may stick. Not some crazy fast machine for God knows how much, like previous 335d. This one has a chance to be a left brain choice, all things considered.

The salesguy was pleasant and no pressure, cause this was an ""event"". We had a nice chat about other improvements BMW made, such as voice recognition, map search, etc. I say they better, because mine are pretty useless. I'm sure other manufacturers make similar strides. I just hope they'll fix the steering, put more feedback, even if it's through fake software. I just hate that buickey feel.

555,dino001,October 2013,"Yeah, I know. I don't fit that crowd. Even if I bought things with short term in mind, I never found a lease I liked - at least so far. It was mostly because those models I got DID NOT have as good lease incentives, as those volume models. Converted money factors were higher than purchase interest rates, even before rolling in lease fees, and residual is only slightly inflated, which was the case for my current wagon. Basically the deal would have been nothing to write home about, so why would I lease? My previous cars were Subarus and those guys don't inflate residuals at all - in fact STI I bought in 2008 had a very bad residual when compared with what I could actually sell it for after three years. But 2011/2012 was abnormal, as tsunami crippled the Subaru's supply and inflated the their used car prices, which I think is the case even until today.

Bottom line, lease doesn't work for my favorite models, at least never has so far - that's why I look at the actual prices. And those are bonkers on new 3-series: 328 easy over $50K, 335 easy high $50s, sometimes over $60K, if you like ""stuff"". It is at least 5 grand higher than just a few years ago, on the sticker anyway. The cash incentives have to roll out on that. I wonder where it will go, hope they won't evolve to old ""the Cadillac way"", where price on the sticker meant absolutely nothing.

2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
558,dino001,October 2013,"I just discovered something that does not make me feel that great. BMW changed their paid maintenance period for new cars to 12K miles/12 months, from previously 16K miles/12 months. This means they either had too much resistance from their dealer base (this would not be such a big problem), or discovered that the oil simply doesn't last as they originally thought/claimed (this obviously is a big issue). What about existing customers, those who bought in last few years and sticked to the computer recommended schedule? I'm not very happy. Seems like those who warned about this being an issue are now validated. The only consolation I can think of is that my commute is at least 75% highway, if not more and my engine is naturally aspirated vs. current BMW lineup is all turbocharged. From my previous turbo owning times (had two Subarus with such engines), I know they tend to go through oil faster than naturally aspirated engines (turbos spin at 5-10 times engine spin). I may be OK long term and no damage done, but it does not make me happy to think BMW was either too cheap or too arrogant in thinking that they can get away with those long periods.

I'm going to call my dealer to ask about this. Not a happy camper.
2018 430i Gran Coupe"
559,alltorque,October 2013,"Would be very surprised if this was an oil-capability issue. It is almost certainly a dealer/revenue-driven issue.

Don't have a BMW but a neighbour has a 320i. The service indicator, when reset after the annual service just tells him that next service is due in 1 year or 18000 or so miles. I doubt anything has changed for 2014............same oil and no huge incidence of failed engines.

America has traded on ridiculously short oil-drain intervals for year. Lube oil was low cost so no issue. Not so here in Europe.

My '06 Volvo S60 D5 has an oil change interval of 1 year or 18,000 miles. Doesn't burn any between changes and is in top form with a mere 94,000 miles on it, (just about run-in my dealer reckons :-)).

Some years ago I was working here in Europe with a senior guy from the USA lubes division of the oil major we both worked for. He got all excited one day about America announcing that their oil would now run to 10,000 mile oil changes.............but for gasoline engines only. I was driving a VW Group diesel at the time, (A Skoda Fabia vRS with the 130bhp 1.9TDi PD). He was devastated to hear that the standard oil drain for that engine was 10,000 miles..............in Europe. Most VW engines, incl diesels are now 20,000 mile drains.

The BMW change is not oil/engine driven but - in my experienced opinion - cost/dealer greed-driven. America has been mis-informed for years on oil change intervals."
560,graphicguy,October 2013,"alltorque...I agree. The BMW oil change intervals is probably a function of the dealer revenue stream than it is with the oil breaking down (BMW uses synth oil).

That said, when I owned my BMW, the oil changes were ""whenever the indicator for an oil change comes one, or one year, whichever comes first"".

I remember hearing of people who were going as much as 17K between oil changes because the oil change indicator never came on.

Don't remember when BMW started doing ""free maintenance"" with loooonnng deltas between oil changes. But, I would think by now, there would be some evidence that they were detrimental. I haven't heard any complaints, though.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
561,dino001,October 2013,"I don't know - these 2.0 turbos are still only 3 years in service, it is possible that they got some statistically significant results prompting them to shorten the mileage between changes. It wouldn't be visible from an average person's view (his nearest dealer's garage), as not many of those engines reached 100K miles yet, but from corporate view they might be seing emerging patterns for those subsamples of the long mileage engines across the world. Just saying, it's possible.

If you are right, it would mean BMW gave into paying dealers more, as first 50K miles is on their dime. Not sure why they'd do that - perhaps it was a dealer apeasement move to give them potentially one more BMW-paid changes. 15K+ miles per year would generate four BMW-paid oil changes per 50K/4 year initial warranty period, instead of three, but it would create a justification for more visits after the period ended. It may not be high price to pay for dealer's happyness.

On other comments, I hear exactly what you are saying. US-based traditional maintenance periods and recommendations (proverbial Jiffy Lube/Joe's Chevy 3 thousand miles on ""severe schedule"") are RIDICULOUS. They were developed during old ""dyno"" oil times for engines that were not very well made. As you said, it is very common to see 25K-30K kilometer (15-20K miles) maintenance periods in Europe, even for lowly Toyotas and Fords, often having same/similar engines to those used here. There are differences, though - European practice is ""come not very often, but leave a lot of money at each visit and do as we say or else (including exact oil brands and grades) and to maintain warranty you HAVE TO do it with us"". American practice has been ""come as often as we tell you, but we will charge you relatively small amount of money and use substandard materials, but there is no harm because you change it so often"". It's evolving, as manufacturers have stretched those periods here, but as you said yourself - not nearly as much as across the Pond, because dealers wouldn't have it. BTW, one difference is, European authorized service stations are not necessarily attached to sales dealerships - they sometimes function as separate franchises, which here is almost unheard of. This gives manufacturers better leverage there to divide constituancies and play them separately.

When I had my Acura, I used to take the oil with me for the oil changes -- I would take a 5-quart container of Mobil 1 or some other name brand 100% synthetic oil -- after the change there would still be oil left in the container.

My wife's X3, for example, however, would take 8+ quarts for an oil change. I am assuming you can safely go further on oil that is less dirty. The more oil capacity the car has the more dirty oil it can handle -- no wonder Infiniti, etc, expects oil change intervals of 3,750 miles -- their cars don't hold much oil.

Also the Euro cars require synthetic oil, the Japanese cars do not. I assume American cars, for the most part, fall into the no synthetic oil policy, too.

Oil is better now -- than then. Engines (at least of Euro cars) are better now than ever. Oil change intervals of 10, 15 even 20K miles are probably not an issue for cars with well made and well lubricated engines. :surprise:

Mark....I concur that engines are made more prcisely these days. Plus, it's much easire to measure the fluid effectiveness with the amount of computers on board. Plus, fluids (not just oil) are much better today than they were. Case in point, the use of synthetics.

I don't know why Infiniti has such an aggressive oil change schedule but not all Japanese luxury cars(I noticed your slight but won't go there) are like that. Your TL certainly didn't require them that often did it? My Acura just had it's first oil change at 7200 miles and the oil monitor was on 30% oil life remaining. I had it changed because it was at the one year mark. I guess it could have went to 9k or so before the oil life monitor would have indicated an oil change and probably more if I did a lot more freeway driving."

Now to answer your question: Infiniti dealers use old-school mineral oil on those still fairly modern engines. For those not to sludge, I suspect you need to have keep this oil new and change it often. I guess the pact is come often, pay small entrance fee (for the oil change) and we will find four opportunities per year to pick your pocket on something else we will ""find"" or invent.

In those terms, Infiniti's schedule does not push any limits, it's well within established limits of that community, from Jiffy Lube to Bob's Chevy, driving 3K/3M schedule ad naseam.

I've been a 3,000 to 4,000 mile oil change type guy, but have never used synthetic oil. Volvo provides the first 5 oil changes, per their schedule, at their expense. So when I took mine in at 5,000 miles for a change on my dime, the tech thought I was nuts. Someone else who I consider knowledgeable in this area said I'm wasting money and resources. I did have the oil changed again at 10,000 miles, free. I've recently come to the conclusion that I will have the oil changed at every 10,000 miles.

Interesting that Volvo tech would tell you that. Perhaps it was a real tech, not the salesman. My friendly BMW ""advisor"" would sell me $600 of services at our first meeting (1 yr, car had 15K), if I only bought them, that's of course on top of that ""free"" maintenance that they are so eager to advertise when they want to sell you the car. Best part, which I really loved (NOT), he printed out a sheet with those three bargain priced ($200 each) services with statement like ""customer requests x service"". Wow, there is no shame in this world. No, customer does NOT request x service.

BTW, those ""recommendations"" were so ridiculous (power steering fluid change and injector cleaning - at 15,000 miles!) that even he didn't have much of a conviction to selling them. He moved immediately into ""from those three you really need only this one"", which was a bargain-priced alignment at $200. I told him, well, as much as I actually may agree with you on this one, I won't do it at your price. Got one done at $125 by a specialised independent garage. In the process I learned that BMW's alignment is not so easy - tire stores, so eager to sell you one, usually at aroun $70-$80, wouldn't even touch my car. Something to do with electronics. So I'm not surprised the dealer wants $200. If there is no big competition, why not charge arm an leg.

579,alltorque,October 2013,"Volvo S60 T5 in Europe is oil change at 18,000 miles or 1 year, whichever comes first. This assumes correct viscosity and spec. Engines are same on both continents. Volvo oil specs are universal I believe, (SAE 0w-30, ACEA A5/B5), so.................it's all to do with greed and nothing to do with oil quality or engine life. 10,000 mile changes in Europe would be cause for rioting in the streets. Even using ACEA A1/B1 poverty spec it's 12,000 miles. Same old same old.

I've been running my '06 S60 D5 (185bhp turbodiesel), on correct Volvo oil - as above - and yearly changes and at 94,000 miles, (first year was only 5,000 miles as it was a Volvo UK staff car), it's just getting better; no smoke, good consumption, no oil burn and pulls like a train. What more can I say ?

Have a look at the recommendation chart here. Basic engines are still the same but some ancillaries may have changed and later engines have more power due to better chipping. For a modest sum Volvo will re-chip my D5 from 185bhp to 205bhp to match current version.

581,markcincinnati,October 2013,"It seems that Audi, BMW and soon Volvo (among other Euro brands) are quickly becoming car companies that motivate virtually all of their cars with some form of a forced induction engine. Turbo charging seems to be the go-to forced induction technology. Audi and Mercedes use superchargers in some applications -- but the majority of the Euro brands (and also starting to show up in non-Euro brands, to be sure) are not naturally aspirated any more.

It is my understanding -- and I certainly could be misinformed -- that forced induction engines need to have their oil changed more frequently than non forced induction engines. The reason, I believe, is heat and dirt -- and in the case of turbos, the very high speeds at which the impellers spin.

It is indeed impressive that these engines, when equipped with large oil tanks and with ever improving oil filtration, can go often a MINIMUM of 10K miles between changes. I do think, however, that there is still no harm in changing the oil by 15K miles, no matter what the on-board computer says. My wife's 2008 X3 engine computer wouldn't let on that it wanted an oil change until 18K miles had passed. At that time, that just seemed crazy to me -- but I was OK with 15K miles.

Another thing these Premium (ELLPS) cars seem to require (disobey at your own peril) is a ""top-tier gasoline"" meaning that the gasoline has cleaning additives 5X more than is ""required"" and so forth. When my sales rep gave me the keys to my 2014 S4 he actually said ""use a top-tier"" gasoline (your fuel injectors will thank you.) Of course, I always try to use this type of fuel.

582,robr2,October 2013,"I believe one might see a shorter oil change interval on turbo engines. I wonder how the oil sensor gizmo on the current BMW turbos schedules it?

If one throttles a turbo engine regularly, then I could see the need for more frequent oil changes. But in normal everyday driving, the turbo isn't put under much stress, generates less heat and thus doesn't break down the oil."
583,cdnpinhead,October 2013,"is ingrained in a truck owner's (doesn't apply to company drivers) daily routine: let it warm up before going full-throttle and, much more importantly, let it and the cooling (oil & water) systems stabilize before shutting the engine down. I let the EGT drop to300 degrees or lower before I shut down (and it often took 2 - 5 minutes) -- prevents coking, among other things. It's not often that a mechanical engineer ends up being a truck driver, but when it happens things can be learned.

It'll be very interesting to see how car turbos respond, long-term, to the hands-off, ignorant operation & maintenance practices of the American public. These are the people who can't be troubled to use directional signals, so they're likely to come off an uphill run on the freeway, park and turn the car off immediately. It'll be a hide-and-watch moment.

That said, oil change intervals for a turbo engine certainly need to be shorter than for NA engines. Whether the manufacturers agree remains to be seen.

586,alltorque,October 2013,"Read my above post ref Volvo S60 turbodiesel oil changes. Whilst (relatively) small turbo engines may be fairly new to USA, at least in volume terms, they have been around in Europe and Japan for quite some time; particularly the diesel variety. Oil change intervals of 18,000 to 20,000 miles are not at all unusual from the major manufacturers and these engines seem to go on forever. Of course, abused turbos, (i.e. not allowing a cooling-down period. After a period of high revs a gentle amble around urban roads of 2 - 3 miles will suffice or a 2 min+ idle), will fail sooner than is considered normal.

To take advantage of their tax laws, Japanese manufacturers have used 660 - 695cc turbo gasoline engines, (yes, 0.7 litre), that are real screamers and some have made it to Europe in more mainstream cars.

Here in Europe, VW Group have been selling the VW Polo GTi and Skoda Fabia vRS small hatchbacks that have their 1.4 TSI engine which is both turbo- and super-charged to give 170bhp and 250Nm, mated to a 7-spd DSG 'box. Fun little devices. Despite being reasonably highly rated, these engines have official oil change intervals of 1 year or 15,000 miles.........same as the overall service schedule. You have to use the correct spec oil, though. But let's be fair, lube oil is the cheapest component in the car; and one of the most important. To be fair, there were reported software problems with some of the early engines which could cause misfires and potential piston damage but AFAIK that is no longer an issue.

So, there is no reason that turbo- engines should be saddled with lower oil change intervals - the experience already exists over many years. Unless, of course, it's driven by dealer financial considerations."
587,dino001,October 2013,"I guess it may vary from region to region. Eastern Europe seems to be still ""customer service challenged"", at least Poland is. Basically any kind of warranty work used to be a torture there, authorized service stations are still not reliable source of quality work (it's a crap shoot), press is full of reports of denied warranties under most bizzarre pretences, or smallest customer infractions. It is getting better, bad publicity and social media are putting more and more pressure. I would not be surprised if Western Europe, having much longer and better established consumer rights and customer service, was much better.

591,flightnurse,October 2013,"Graphic, I have only driven the car about 200 miles, but so far...

Power:
Very adequate for daily driving, merging onto the freeway or driving around town the turbo engine has an effortless to it. Whether you get the 320 or 328 the cars have three modes for power-train, Sport, Normal/comfort and Eco.
Sport the engine mapping is changed as well as shift points. Shifts at a higher RPM, the throttle has an aggressive feel to it. The transmission will rapidly fire off shift very much like Duel clutch auto does.
Normal is really ""comfort"" the transmission shifts more smoothly and the engine mapping isn't as aggressive. So far this is where I leave it.
Eco is just that, the throttle has a lazier feel to it and the transmission will get into higher gear quicker. Having the car in sport and accelerating from a stop light/sign the car ""feel"" quicker and the shifts are quicker than the advertise 180hp. Also there very little TURBO LAG in this car. Truly impressed with it. I did drive a 328i and was very impressed with it. Now granted, these are 4 cyl and are not as smooth as the 6 cyl, no, but overall one would be hard pressed to know there is a 6 cyl under the hood.

Engine
Not as smooth as the 6cyl, when the 4 cyl is cold it is rougher and courser, but once at operating temperature things smooth out a little.
The Auto start/stop.
It&#146;s unnerving to come to a stop and the engine dies, however, when the A/C is running the engine will stop for roughly 20-30 seconds but will restart and stay running. When the engine is cold it will not stop, it must be at operating temp for this feature to run. I have decided to allow this feature to work, I want to see if it really bothers me. There are times when the engine restarts and it&#146;s rougher than others. We all know this feature is to help with MPG, and once BMW gets their MPG up, this feature will go away. The 328d is start

Driving
Now I only have about 200 miles of butt time in the car, so of course my impressions will change. Now I have had an E36 328i, E46 330i, E90 328i and now this F30 320i. They all drive the same but different. They all had/have that tectonic feel to them that only the Germans can do. All of the other BMWs have had the sport package, this is my first without it. I don&#146;t have enough butt time to really make a true statement on the seats, currently I&#146;m not 100% happy with them but I&#146;m not 100% disappointed with them either. I can say that this is the quietest 3 series I have owned, there is no wind noise at the A pillars at all, when you close the doors, they close with that German tank &#147;thunk&#148;. The steering, I have read both in print and in this forum how people hate the elec steering and how &#147;numb&#148; it feels. There is a difference between my pervious 3 series and this current car, it is lighter which is nice when parking. Now can I say that the steer has no feedback, no, and I don&#146;t think anyone can say that for certain until you take the car out on the track and drive to 6/10 of the cars potential. So far, the steering has not been an issue for me. I haven&#146;t driven it on the track and I highly doubt I will, but one never knows.

Base Car;
So all BMWs now come with the latest iDrive (ver 4.2), and I like it. It is very easy to use, and it make it very easy to get around and make the necessary changed to the car settings. Yes, there is a learning curve to it but I like it. I wish my car had the BMW assist, which I will have it added to the car, this is one feature in which I wish it came standard in the 2013 MY, it does for the 2014 MY. The features of this base car is pretty impressive, it has all power everything, it even has power side mirror to retract in (I just wish they would retract automatically.) Auto temp, rain senor wipers, fog lights, and auto headlights. I can set the ventilation system to run the fans while I&#146;m away from the car to help keep the car cool, it&#146;s a nice feature here in the desert. All four windows are auto down. One annoying feature is, to get out, the car does not auto unlock the car is placed park or turning the car off, and to get out of the car, you must pull door handle twice, first to unlock the car and the second to open the door. I&#146;m not understanding this feature
Wheels, standard is 17&#148;, and mine came with Michelin run flat tires. I was surprised on not seeing Continental tires.

The interior space is pretty big, I had 4 adults&#146; males in the car roughly my size 6&#146;, 260lbs and everybody didn&#146;t feel cramped. MPG for the car has been impressive, Rick tells me that the car is averaging currently 32 MPG. So a 550 miles range on the highway is very doable.

On the forum Bimmerfest, there has been talk about the engine difference between the 320 and 328 and according from BMW there is no difference except for a higher boost level and different engine mapping in the 328i, there is a performance company that has two different set up for the 320i for more power, stage one is a true plug in which give the 320i an extra 40 hp. Total cost, $375. Stage two again is a plug in and gives an extra 80hp to 260hp, more than the 328i but less than the 335. Total cost is $600. Reliability hasn&#146;t been an issue with the test cars, btw, all test cars for the company have the 8 spd auto.

I bought this BMW as an experiment really to see if the &#147;base&#148; 3 series, has the same DNA as previous 3 series and if the price of admission is worth it. So my car is equipped how most would find on a BMW lots, with the Premium package. Now I can say that the Sport Package is really worth the price of admission, since it comes with the M sport suspension. From what I have read on Bimmerfest, the 320i Sport Package is really the M Sport Package minus the M sport aero kits, the Steering wheel has the M logo on it.
So far I like the car, and yes it is bigger than the E90, but it is lighter than the E90. Of course many people on Bimmerfest and this forum do not like the F30, I read people saying that it has lost the &#147;sport&#148; in Sport Sedan. But to honest when the E90 came out many of the BMW purest were the saying the same thing, and in some way I was one of them. The E46 was and is today the best 3 series BMW built. But as we all know things change, and buyers change and the market change. I&#146;m in the camp that I wish BMW would build a modern 3 series the ZHP package again.

Now I welcome all questions and comments, however, if the comments are purely being disrespectfully then please keep them to yourself.

Well, regarding Costco gasoline: the description that Costco provides (usually around the pump areas, but also available at the customer service desk) pertaining to the benefits of using Costco gas appear to describe a ""top-tier"" gasoline product. Costco's brochure says their gas products do indeed have 5X the cleaning agents required by the most stringent automotive requirements (I would assume, Audi, BMW, Mercedes and other Euro mfgrs.)

I use Costco gas as much as possible, too, due both to its typical price point (advantage) and its apparently being a top-tier automotive fuel. Otherwise I use Shell gasoline (as if you care.)

599,markcincinnati,October 2013,"My ""favorite"" car -- of all of them I have ever had -- used to be my 1995 Audi S6 (the first year the car was called an S6, previously it had been called an S4). This car had been my favorite from an emotional perspective, not that the '95 S6 was a performance slouch (it wasn't). I actually had cars (mostly Audis) that were, perhaps, 'better overall' -- but none that could capture and frame a certain period of my life.

If that doesn't make sense, that I can differentiate between my favorite car and what I would consider my ""best"" car, then certainly this won't help either: My favorite Procol Harum album is Broken Barricades -- but I think the best one is A Salty Dog. Now it is all clear as mud, eh?

602,dino001,October 2013,"I experienced first real failure in my now 2-year old 328 wagon. It was the liftgate latch assembly. One nice morning the car is showing ""gate open"" warning, so I got out, closed it again. The warning is still on, so I try again and again. No avail. What's also strange, the glass window in the gate (yes, similar feature to those on bog SUVs) would not open. As it turned, the dealer is replacing both latch assemblies, gate and glass window. I'm sure it's one of those classic electrical motor things, or perhaps even electronic control module. Sign of times and designs - 10 cent capacitor or resistor fails on a small circuit board and you get full-blown $500 repair.

Nothing is simple today - it used to be, you shut the door, spring latch engaged mechanically. Today when I close my car (without locking, just shut the last door or hatch), I can often hear several motors engaging for one-two seconds. This of course means those are candidades for parts that could fail sooner than later. I can only hope it's not a start of all other electronic/electrical components going. Will see - if I get one of those every two years, I'd be allright. On the other hand, if I have to visit dealerships more frequently from now for those kinds of problems, I'll have to think about what's next. The electronics are wonderful inventions that made our lifes easier in many places, but it seems we are now relying on them in so many places for sometimes inexplicable reasons. Simple door latch is now some electronic module with motor and circuitry attached. All of that has lifespan much more limited than those traditional locks and we all pay for it sooner or later. What's worse, the repair people are not handy enough to change those 10 cent parts (that actually failed), they make buy entire assembly costing hundreds - and you can't do anything about it, as when those electronic controls fail, they can't be simply overriden by a switch. Depending what it is, the machine can get completely disabled or you can get locked out, or you get those annoying warnings on a dashboard lighting like a Xmas tree.

OK, rant over. Hopefully everything will go back to normal. I really like the car and want to keep it.

Most of the reviews center on the A4, like the reviews on BMW's 3....rarely do you see a review on the 335i.

It was several weeks ago, but I read some of the Costco literature stating that they planned on getting ""top tier"" certification as soon as they convert all of their gas stations to ""top tier"" capabilities (BTW, both Costco's in Cincinnati already are coverted to ""Kirkland Signature""). I've use their fuel for over 10 years. It is a great product, and much less expensive to boot.

606,m6user,October 2013,"It seems strange that so many ""electrical glitches"" happen in German brands very early on. I'm not sure how many take place later as it seems so many of them are leased and you don't hear much from the people that buy them used. Makes one wonder if actually kept past warranty? I realize that the fixes are cheap(warranty) but time is also money. I had a 10 year old Infiniti that never had a bulb or a motor fixed or replaced. I currently have a 10 year old Toyota pickup that also has never had a bulb or motor fixed or replaced. We also have a 6 year old with Mazda that has never had a motor fixed or replaced and it just went over 103k miles. However, I just replaced a halogen headlight last week on the Mazda for a grand total of $8.99 and about 10 minutes of my labor.

I just had my first service(oil change/rotation) on my new Acura and it is the first time I've been back to the dealer in a year except for a class on how to use all the tech stuff. I have to wonder if it's just the lack of quality of the motors, latches and switches that the German brands use versus the Japanese brands. I would find it hard to believe that it could be attributable to the actual manufacturing process in the German plants as I've spent quite a bit of time in Germany and know how exact they can be. I also wonder if the the U.S. made BMWs use different suppliers for those items(I assume they probably do) and if there are substantially less problems in those areas on the U.s. made vs. the German made vehicles. Just curious I guess. Based on all the reports(not just in this forum) of electrical bugaboos in the German brands it seems they could do a better job of sourcing parts if a $20k midsize Japanese brand car can have better electrical parts than a $50k ELLPS. I read something once that blamed many of these electrical gremlins on cheap Eastern Euro electrical parts that VW was sourcing but really can't substantiate that.

I realize there are trade offs in life but it sure would be a pain in the [non-permissible content removed] to have go the dealer so often to get little things like that taken care of."

611,dino001,October 2013,"I don't think it's the Eastern Europe issue. Most electronics today are made in East Asia or Eastern Europe, it is all controlled by handfull of companies. I think it's more about attitude and cost controls. Relays, electrical items have certain lifetime designed into them (say X hours). One rated for half of those hours can cost one tenth of the price - and it looks just the same. It becomes irresistible for them to try, especially that chances are, majority will work for much longer. That rating may come from statistical sampling that certain percentage will meet the time criteria and to achieve same percentage of the the longer time, manufacturing process would have to be redesigned, making part that much more expensive. Cost-benefit for manufacturer becomes such that it's cheaper to deal with higher percentage repairs than pay for one that lasts. Why Germans do that and Japanese stick to better quality? This may have to do with cost of labor. There is only so much you can do to add efficiency. German labor is simply most expensive, not just due to wages, but also additional costs, from social security, to taxes, to benefits. Only so much can be paid out of customer's money, before they refuse.

Bear also in mind that Mercedes Benz or BMW used to be trully exclusive brands, only for trully rich. They all have ambitions to sell more and more cars. Those cars are sold in milions. They may be ""premium"", but they are far cry from those 600 SEL from 60s or 70s in terms of cost and reach.

They wanted me to do a test drive. I declined. For nearly $40K, I think I'll pass. You can get a nice A4 for that money....or, an ATS....or a 320i...all of which I think are nicer vehicles. Heck...you can get a loaded up Acura ILX for less than that. Or, in reality, a G37x is selling for less than that these days.

623,graphicguy,October 2013,"m6...I pulled this out of my old file when I had my TL a few years ago. This is what Acura stated about the oil life monitor...

""The TL has a Maintenance Minder system that automatically monitors the vehicle's unique operating condition to indicate to the driver when maintenance is required. Maintenance alerts are presented when the ignition is first turned on, not while driving (to prevent driver distraction). The system monitors engine operating conditions such as fluid temperatures and engine speed to determine the proper service intervals. The Multi-Info Display (MID) located below the fuel and engine temperature gauges in the instrument cluster indicates the remaining percentage of engine oil life, and then shows service is due with a ""wrench"" icon. A percentage-based countdown to the next service is displayed when the car is within 15 percent of the end of the service interval. A letter and number code is displayed to indicate the specific type of service that is required. If the service is missed, the MID indicates past-due mileage to express the urgency of the required service to the driver.

The system is designed to eliminate unnecessary maintenance procedures, environmental impact and expenses, while ensuring that important service issues are addressed. In some cases, oil change intervals can extend to a maximum of 10,000 miles, which could spare the owner considerable money and inconvenience over the life of the car. The owner-resettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems, including oil, oil filter, tire rotation, air-cleaner, automatic transmission fluid, spark plugs, timing belt, coolant, brake pads and more.""

Thinking back to when the manufacturers stated oil change intervals based on mileage alone, I think the monitors might give a more accurate guesstimate on when your oil is depleted.

I remember a mechanic friend who I would consult in my younger days of building a (money pit) track car, telling me he could tell if the oil was depleted just by smell and by rubbing the dip stick in between his fingers. I was amazed at that. Until I realized all he was doing was feeling for grit in the oil, and trying to determine if the oil smelled ""burnt"". Not very scientific. Of course, we didn't use synth oil, either.

624,Michaell,October 2013,"No doubt they'll sell a lot of them...at least initially. I think those of us who fall on the ""sports"" side of luxury sport vehicles would be disappointed, though. Just one man's opinion.

graphicguy - I went to the local MB dealer a couple of weeks ago to take a closer look at the CLA. You would have thought that a Kardashian kid had showed up, there were so many people surrounding the car.

Like you noticed, the two they had on the lot were stickered in the $36-38K range. Quite a bit of money for what is a pretty small car. I guess everyone wants to play in the 'compact luxury' arena these days.

I agree with you - those people wanting something sporty will probably shop elsewhere. 320i, A4, ATS would be good alternatives.

Where it gets tricky is that you can option up some more pedestrian brands to that mid 30's price range - Optima, Accord, Fusion - and get way more features for the money. And, save money on maintenance. And, perhaps get a better warranty.

Bottom line is that the lines are beginning to blur on the luxury side of the equation.

More features don't always impress me. While initially these were impressive new features...I no longer feel the ""wow"" about power mirrors and windows (a little tongue n' cheek here...). For me, after a few months the ""new"" features are ""ho-hum"". Not to say I wouldn't want power windows on a new MB

I initially felt this about in-car nav's. They were amazing and seemed worth the thousands they commanded. Now it seems they are used as a tool to gouge the consumer; they'll integrate additional features (customizable settings, etc)...so if you want the 'features' you pony up for the nav.

My former IS had the nav and I explicitly searched for one, but I never used the nav. My large phone with Google maps was always far more accurate and easy to use (and I didn't have to buy an expensive DVD every year to upgrade).

The back seat may be a bit cramped, but the CLA is a bigger car than the current C class in every dimension.

I haven't compared a loaded mainstream vehicle to the CLA, but if I'm right at $35K I think i'd forego an 'option' for the CLA style.

Just saw a Kia Optima that one my best friend's wife bought. When did those things get to be so nice?

For $36K, is a CLA built better, does it perform better, have better materials, last longer, etc...than a loaded up (and less expensive) Accord? Hmmmm...I can't make that leap.

Then again, I thought it was absurd when I read an article a year or so ago stating that a Mustang GT is the equal of a BMW M3. Maybe I'm starting to see the point.

The times I walked into a Benz showroom, I always walk out believing there were better alternatives for a lot less money.

With the CLA, MB is cashing in the chits they earned from the years their cars were considered overbuilt and overengineered...available only to the rich. Today? I'm not seeing it.

I've probably hit the high end of my tolerance for how much I'm willing to pay for a car, regardless of its capabilities.

Every so often I'll pick up a copy of CAR magazine, to see what's happening across the pond.

Some years back, one of their editors wrote a column that talked about the shrinking middle class of car manufacturers. The improvement of Hyundai & Kia (and the other ""low"" cost brands available in Europe) and the continuing down market efforts of BMW, Audi and MB meant that popular brands like Ford, Vauxhall/Opel, Renault and Peugeot were getting squeezed.

Might that be happening here in the States? It's possible, quite possible.

644,markcincinnati,October 2013,"Quick take: 2014 S4 S-Tronic (333 HP 325 lb ft).

There must be some reason that Audi would understate the power of one (or more for all I know) of their engines. Maybe it is a tax thing in Germany. Whatever the reason, it seems to me that there is no way this car has only 333 HP and 325 lb ft.

I had heard that the 2.0T's power as it stands in the current A6 is understated (and I have driven the car and it does seem impossible that it is 220 HP motivating a car that big) and I read a test report of the S8 that wagged its finger at Audi for understating that engine, too, so I guess it must be an Audi practice to under-rate their engines.

Of course, other than for tax reasons (if that really is true), why would they do this? I recall that Acura (and others) had to restate the power of the RL's 3.7L V6 (to less than 300 HP), suggesting to me that most car companies would probably like to find a way to overstate the power numbers (HP measured at sea level on a cold day, for instance).

In any case, even with less than 1,000 miles on it, the S4 seems to have great, surprising, reserves of power -- perhaps sports car power. An RS version must be dangerous, if this S version is any indication.

Once again, I find myself wondering why the recent spate of car magazine sport sedan comparos doesn't include this car!?"
645,flightnurse,October 2013,"Mark when it comes to HP, the German's have always done it different. If you take the BMW 335i, the car makes 300hp and 300 lbs of torque, however, ifyou look at the times it run, there is no way that a 300hp car can run that fast, and dyno test have proven over and over again that it makes more power. Also the 7 spd DSG helps too. I also believe that engines today make power more efficiently then before. My 320i only makes 180hp and 200lbs of torque but the passing on the highway is effortless..."
646,scwmcan,October 2013,"As for why the magazines aren't testing the S4 with the others, it may have lost a comparision test with one of the others in the past, I am not sure how old the current A/S4 is. Also the may be justifying it by testing RWD performance sedans, maybe they will do an AWD test later ( not saying it is right, but might be their thinking). I think generally the first answer is the reason ( same reason the c-class isn't in the tests). That said I am sure the A/S4 is right up there with the others, and depending on what you are looking for may be the best."
647,markcincinnati,October 2013,"Drove from Cincinnati to Columbus and back yesterday -- on the way back, crossed over to 1,000+ miles on the OD.

Well, for reasons I cannot imagine -- other than the fact that here in Ohio we have raised the top speed limit from 65 to 70mph (and EVERYBODY does limit+10 and lots do limit+20) -- I got in with a ""pack"" of cars cruising along between 85 and 90, and for the hell of it, I got in the left lane and punched it for just a couple of seconds: an indicated 101mph ""just like that!"" Poof.

I'm destined to get a ticket. Thank god for cruise control.

I have a now outdated iPhone 5 and it uses the new ""little"" connector. The solution (and no charge) was for the dealer to give me an Audi connector that has a USB female plug on it. I take the 110 volt AC plug off of the cable, plug the USB male into the female and I at least have the ability to keep the iPhone charged. I don't seem to have any of the control or selection features I would have if I had an iPhone 4. This means, I turn on Bluetooth, plug in the USB, fire up the system and punch up whatever I want to listen to ON THE PHONE itself, then put the phone in the glove box and let whatever playlist I have selected run its course.

My ""old"" Acura TL worked perfectly and seemed way way better integrated with both my iPhone and my Kindle Fire (which I used to use for audio books; now I use an iPhone app to do the same thing.)

Endnote3: I got used to having the garage door opener work with the car turned off on the Acura, can't do it on the Audi. This means you have to close the garage door with the engine running -- I know it is only a few seconds, but with all the software controlled things the MMI permits/enables, you'd think there could be a menu item that lets you choose what will operate with the engine off. I know this is a picking of the nits, but there needs to be a software update to take care of some of the little things that shouldn't be on a nearly $57K car.

Back 7 years ago, I think only BMW was doing ED and there were packages to drive through Switzerland and down into Italy, Lake Como to be specific.

The savings, with FOB originating in Munich, could result in a lease that saved you enough to pay for the trip to Germany (maybe not to tour around Europe though).

I see now that Mercedes and Audi are offering ED again.

So do these and the BMW ED programs still offer substantial savings on leases?

But, I experienced the progression and transformation from sports sedan into luxo badged car first hand with each one I had.

The newer ones are indeed faster than the '87 325i, but none of them were as much fun to drive. Not really sure their fuel economy is better, either.

Q50 has been widely panned. So, doubt that would be on my short list.

A4? I'm probably going to give Audi a rest once I move from my S4 in a year, or so.

If I were in the market today? For ~$40K (using available discounts), I'd probably spring for another Acura TL SH AWD with Tech package. I'm really interested to see what Acura brings out next spring with the new TL(X).

To get what I want in a 3 Series, I'd probably have to go with at least a 328ix (with the preference being a 335ix). Equipped the way I want, assuming a $3K-$4K discount, I'd still be in that upper $40K range, into the low $50K range. That's a price range I think hits into the ""diminishing returns"" category, however.

Although, I do find the upcoming M235i intriguing.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
666,markcincinnati,October 2013,"I would urge you to get the Advance, not Tech version of the TL. I got a 13% discount on my 2012, Advance, so my guess is they have more to play with in that car -- and you will get the 19"" wheels which both improve the turn in and looks.

Moreover, you get the really cool (pun intended) vented seats -- and, most importantly blind spot monitoring.

I know y'all will give me grief, but FOR THE MONEY the TL SH-AWD Advance is Acura's version of an S4.

The thing is, for most, just too ugly, hence no matter what I say to anyone they just can't get past the looks.

Again, for the money, the Acura as noted above is worth cross shopping with the S4 -- now, is the Acura likely to be confused with the S4? Nope.

Is the S4, lightly optioned, worth $10,000 more than the TL? Yep.

Would most folks cross shop these two cars? I doubt it.

If you can't or don't want to afford an S4 and the new Q50 leaves you cold, your only ""cheap"" choice is the TL SH-AWD Advance. All in with the TL, adding parktronic and upgrading the tires to 19"" UHP ""Z"" or ""Y"" or ""W"" rated rubber, you're going to be at $47K or maybe $48K (MSRP).

BTW: I am not excluding the BMW 335i x-drive -- but, like the S4, it seems (or seemed) to be made of unobtanium; and for some reason the 3 series seems a bit small to me.

The IS 350 F Sport doesn't have the engine the Audi S4 has, of course; and, frankly, the Acura at 305HP feels no less potent than the IS 350.

My S4 is a premium plus S-tronic version in free paint -- Ibis White -- with the upgraded leather seats, MMI+, Blind Spot monitoring, B&O sound system and carbon fiber trim (which looks nice, but for $500? Naaaah.) With shipping the thing was $57K -- $10K more than the TL and $7K more than an IS 350 AWD F-SPORT.

I drove:

Q50S AWD
IS 350 AWD F-Sport
Volvo S60 Type/R (also AWD)
Acura TL SH-AWD Advance
Audi A4 2.0T Sport
Audi A5 2.0T Sport
Audi S4 S-Tronic
Audi S4 6-speed manual shift
Audi SQ5 8-speed Tiptronic (Prestige)

Thinking an S4 (my preference) was ""out of reach"" and not thinking the A4 or A5 2.0T versions had sufficient ""guts,"" and reading the critical reviews of the Q50S, I ordered a 2014 IS 350 AWD F-SPORT in Ultra White with the red leather interior.

My wife, meanwhile, was smitten with the SQ5 Prestige and ordered that. While we were filling out the paperwork on her SQ5, I commented how much I would rather have the S4 than the IS, but that the price of the S4 made it seem to be constructed out of unobtainium.

Days later, Audi dealer says -- I can get you a white S4 S-Tronic with magma red leather and the blind spot warning (which was a deal breaker or maker option) -- and we think, with no money down, we can meet the Lexus' price since you are now eligible for the Audi loyalty discount (since your wife has also rejoined the Audi family.)

The moral of the story: if you can't or don't want to ""afford"" the S4 (or whatever your passion inducing car is), of all of the remaining choices, you will have to give up less if you get the TL SH-AWD Advance than any other car on the ELLPS list -- and you will surely pay less (comparably equipped).

DILYL"
667,graphicguy,October 2013,"Mark...thanks for your insight.

Not sure where I'm going from here. I heard last week that my S4 will probably need a new trans. Granted, it's covered under warranty. But, this is just one in an ongoing series of trips into the service area of the dealership. That, and it seems it could take as long as a month to get it fixed.

Ordinarily, I'd get into the whole ""lemon law"" thing, but I still like the car, believe it or not. It's clear I'm not going to keep it long term, however. So, the quandry becomes how much of a hit will I take if I hold onto it, and try to sell/trade it, and that CARFAX shows all the service it has needed?

I'm going to have to make up my mind relatively quickly here. If I lemon it (I don't think I'll get much pushback), what do I replace it with? This isn't the first time I've lemoned a car (helped my late Mother lemon law her Cadillac several years ago). I know the drill. It'll take a couple of months.

Another Audi? Probably not.

Cadillac? The new CTS intrigues me, but I'm not ponying up another $50K for a car. Plus, there's my lemon law experience with them....not good.

Infiniti....boy, I try and try to like them. I just can't seem to embrace their cars, for a variety of reasons. Same goes for Mercedes. I always feel like I would be paying too much for an underpowered German sedan with them....particularly compared to the competition.

Lexus? I liked the previous IS, except it was small for my tastes. GS? Maybe.

I do think BMW is on the short list. But, as you say, just like the S4, the one I'm interested in (335) is tought to find. Plus, you're breaking way past that $50K mark if you do find one. The M235 intrigues me. There again, you have a size ""thing"".

I do like Acuras. As you say, the TL SH AWD Advance is right there. Plus, from what I'm reading, getting one all loaded up for right around $40K is compelling. I drove my sister's TL a while ago. I may have to borrow hers again.

First things first...I have to decide what to do with the S4.

668,rayainsw,October 2013,"'The M235 intrigues me.'

This M235i looks like it may make
my &#145;short list&#146; in a couple of years.

A couple of specifics:
Performance &#150; the quoted acceleration times from BMW
are almost exactly the same as the 335iS I leased.

Fuel Economy &#150; the EPA estimates are rather
Dramatically better than that 335iS !
[ 22 city / 32 hiway &#150; M235i
17 city / 24 hiway &#150; 2011 335iS ]

The price &#150; at $44K base, including the 8-speed
automatic trans., this compares with $53.5K
for the 2011 335iS, with the 7-speed DCT.

Although this 2 Series is slightly smaller than
the 335, I really do not need anything larger . . .
[ Heck, I had a Corvette as my only vehicle for
over 30,000 miles. ]

And it appears that there may be a 4-door???

Anyway &#150; subject to magazine reports &
a few test drives [ of course ] I do like
what I see and read, so far.

Dealership states that they don't know which parts will be needed UNTIL the trans is out, which makes the car undriveable. So, yeah...it could take awhile, given the parts come from Germany.

I do love the car. I don't like the hassle of taking it to the dealership, seemingly every other week.

I was given the FWD TL Tech (2013) when mine was in for a service interval. The SH-AWD has a ""performance tuned"" suspension. The TL FWD does not.

The SH-AWD Advance has 19"" wheels and, unfortunately, somewhat lackluster All-Season ""V"" rated tires (somewhat stiffer sidewalls), but this version of the TL is only similar to a regular FWD TL in its basic looks.

Add the dealer installed parktronic and scrap the factory rubbers on the TL SH-AWD Advance; replace them with UHP W or even Z rated A/S tires (there are several to choose from -- see Tire Rack.com) and you will have a $47K (MSRP) ""Acura S4-lite."" Next factor in the possibility of a decent discount (10% based on what I see here in River City) should be a no brainer, and remember I got 13% off of the bottom line of the MSRP sticker.

I do caution you to not think that any other version of the TL than the SH-AWD Advance will be ""close enough for jazz."" Is there any NEWNESS on the 2014's, or are we going to have to wait for the 2015 MY to see if the ugly duckling can turn into a beautiful swan?

Full disclosure, my Advance wheels were bent from the get-go, and Acura decided that they would pay only 50% of the cost of the new wheels since they weren't ""discovered"" as bent until 20K miles (I first complained at the first oil change which was just south of 8,000 miles, but Acura thought I had warped brake rotors, not BENT wheels -- so I was given the opportunity to buy factory OE wheels [19""] at the bargain basement price of $650-ish per.)

But I digress -- YES YES YES, the TL SH-AWD Advance comes with both sport tuned suspension bits and 19"" High Performance rubber.

I did like my TL -- but I love my S4. Hopefully I will be the beneficiary of Audis new Consumer Reports reliability rating of #4 most reliable car and #1 most reliable European car.

BTW, the Volvo S60 T6 Type-R is in the MSRP range of the above noted Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. HOWEVER, where Acura will discount the poop out of the TL, Volvo will give perhaps 3 or 4% off (if it is at the end of the month). The trouble with Volvo is they never seem to have any car in stock that pulls it all together.

But wait -- the Volvo European delivery program is one of the best of any manufacturer -- get the DVD that 'splains it. That might make paying closer to sticker a bit more palatable; and if you get the T6 Type-R Polestar Edition, you can drive the thing on the autobahn if you stay a couple of extra days, then turn it back in at one of the drop off points and fly business class back to the states!

After all, my lemon-like Dodge Neon had reasonably OK initial quality. It was the long term quality that reared its ugly head over and over.

The problem was there was no long term quality, it was planned to be obsolete the day after 3 years or the mile after 36,000.

That being said, there were some early tell tale signs that it was not going to be an acceptable car. My view is if I have a significant amount of problems in the first 3 years, odds are it'll be exponentially more after warranty. Then again, my friends Altima blew it's engine and transmission in its first month, and ended up being extremely reliable for about 5-6 years, and then all hell broke loose again.

2nd failed CVT transmission and failed CAT Converter (both covered by Nissan because Nissan knows they are failure prone). I'm still waiting for a ""extended Neon"" warranty check from Chrysler.

Not holding my breath though, it's obvious that Chrysler's culture views a car that has failed head gaskets, AC compressor, and auto transmission all by 60,000 miles (in addition to about 15 other things that broke) as perfectly normal. As the dealer service manager told me ""parts just break down.""

My experience at Honda and Audi and (my best friend with Nissan) is just the polar opposite, it is a culture where parts breakdowns are unacceptable! If it happens, they seem to do they're absolute best at minimizing them.

For example, Honda replacing my transmission out of warranty at 42K miles for free, and doing it in 2.5 days. Audi fixed my AC at 53,000 miles out of warranty in a very similar manner (though it took 2 weeks, but I had an A4 loaner so I was happy). Audi sending me a check for nearly $700 for failed induction control modules since it was warrantied retroactively to 120,000 miles, and my best friends experience with Nissan above.

My AC failed at literally year 3 - day 3 (under 36K miles), and Dodge never blinked an eye for offering assistance.

Head gaskets at 40 or 45k, Dodge dealer made no comment.

Auto transmission at 60k (independent shop's comment was ""I can't believe they are still using those cheap ancient 3-speeds."")

I think I'm justified in not only boycotting the Big 3 for life, but forbidding my children (at least until age 18 I think I can) to give the Big 3 any money. After 18 I'll just have to disown them if they do so. :P

Like the BMW there is a chip for the Audi (really VW) turbo 4, which will increase HP to roughly 256hp, and increase torque to about 290lbs total cost about $350.

Let me provide some perspective that made me read the ""30 months"" statement and cock my head and have a cartoon balloon with a question mark in it appear overhead.

I have a 2014 Audi S4 Premium Plus with MMI+ and the B&O sound system. I also have the silk nappa leather seat upgrade.

Previously I had a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige and sport package equipped 2.0T quattro (it also had the power rear sunshade and ADS and the B&O sound system.)

Before that I had a 2005 Audi A6 3.2 with sport wheels and nav and sport seats (with the $1,000 premium leather option), the Bose sound system and the built in phone cradle and whatever else made a 2005 A6 cost nearly $54,000 new.

Now, I kept my 2005 A6 about 42 months (6 months beyond the end of the lease due to the delayed delivery in 2008 of the 2009 A4's). I kept the 2009 full term and put some 56K miles on it (and 66K miles as I recall on the '05 A6.)

One month ago I get into my new 2014 S4 configured as noted above.

If you would have put me into my new 2005 A6 and I had become familiar with the controls and the layout of everything and the functioning and format of the electronics and then you had me close my eyes for ""a second"" and re-opened them in October 2008 whilst I was seated behind the wheel of my 2009 A4, then repeated the process and I opened my eyes behind the wheel of my 2014 S4, I would have almost thought all that had changed was the color of the seats and dashboards.

My A6 had a black dash with the baseball glove colored leather seats -- the wood trim was walnut dark brown; my A4 had an ecru dash and seats -- the wood trim was oak blonde; next up, the S4 has a black dash with the magma red leather seats and carbon fiber trim.

The electronics (the automotive ""avionics"") were virtually unchanged from calendar year 2004 through 2013 (10 years, 120 months). Yes, there are some incremental (and mostly pretty small) ""improvements"" in the avionics. I can now recite an entire 10-digit phone number and the voice recognition system doesn't respond ""Pardon?"" The moving map is said to be 3D, but that's not literally true, although there is a greater perception of ""depth"" as one looks at the map (sitting or moving).

The B&O system in the 2014 MY S4 MAY be a little bit better than the excellent version of the system circa 2008 in the MY 2009 A4 (and the B&O is better than the Bose that was in the '05 A6.)

Overall, though, I would say there has been no ""built-in obsolescence"" since this car's ""systems"" have been around for 10 years without anything of any real form and/or function changing.

Now, however, therefore, notwithstanding -- I like the B8's electronics/avionics -- just as I did when I first met them in the '05 A6. I continued to enjoy them in the 2009 A4 and although I do -- from time to time -- touch the screen on the S4 thinking it has [or that it MUST have] the same capabilities that most of today's smart-phones and tablet PC's have.

Some are already saying (and have been saying so for some time now) that Audi's interior (from the driver's perspective) is long in the tooth. And, maybe, just maybe keeping the look and feel and user interface pretty much the same for 10 years is TOO long, I think the 2014 A6 interior and electronics package has taken a step back, looking like the second gen Cadillac CTS, which I didn't care for.

I keep my nav screen on almost all of the time. I would hate to have one of those aftermarket looking things (for instance, the pop-up nav that came on gen 2 CTS and the current iteration of A6's) that somehow passes for forward movement. Who's dumb idea was it to spoil the flowing lines of the newest A6 interior with that silly screen that looks, to my eye, as if it were an afterthought.

So. . .built-in obsolescence? 10 years seems about right to me."
716,robr2,November 2013,"What you are looking at is the user interface. What I was talking about was the technology that delivers that user interface. That life is about 30 months.

Maintaining a known interface with just a few tweaks entices current customers to stay with the brand. For many folks, having to learn a new interface when changing car brands would be a major inconvenience. Notice that Apple hasn't changed the ""i"" interface very much. Someone who used an iPhone back in 2007 could wake up today and still be able to use an iPhone. In fact, they could probably use any touch device as Apple set a standard copied by everyone else.

I could say the same thing about Hondas. I bought my first one in 1991, a second in 1998 and a third in 2000. I can climb into just about any Honda and the interface (switches, controls) would be exactly the same. I know it's simpler than the electronic interface you mention, but it's the same idea."
717,markcincinnati,November 2013,"If you are ""shielded"" from the underlying technology by an evolving not radically changing interface, why would you care if the underlying tech was changing every couple of years or so?

I would think, like the Apple iPhone, that we all appreciate that the 4 and the 5S have similar user interfaces but that the tech of the 5 is way faster, etc.

I would hope the underlying tech of my 2014 is much changed over my 2005 A6, in fact I would be ok if it changed annually even if I only change my car every 3+ years or so.

I hate to be dense, but isn't it a good thing that tech keeps marching forward?

I do agree making the thing have deliberate built-in obsolescence just for the sake of making it obsolete would make no sense; but, I am going to assume that while my Audi's user interface has little changed that the underlying stuff has changed (and for the betterment of all human-kind).

Why is it problematic [for you] that some tech is said to have become obsolete in 30 months or whatever time frame. Now the issue I would have is if the tech became unreliable or lacked durability. As far as I know the 2005 A6 MMI system works fine, lasts a long time -- but I would assume, I would hope even that the stuff underneath has been improved and improved and improved since it was first brought to market."
718,cdnpinhead,November 2013,"that a sporty car had a taut suspension that was cleverly designed to allow the vehicle to go around corners like it was ""on rails."" It had a manual transmission that was fun to use. It might have had some kind of big-boy engine that provided ~ 6 second 0-60 runs, but that wasn't necessary by any means. It had some kind of audio system that provided entertainment on straight roads (and otherwise, but it didn't matter so much then).

Now it's all about electronics.

Knock yourselves out.

I wasn't the one that had an issue with the obsolescence of an electronic item. I was the one that stated that hardware - especially consumer electronics - have a short expected life span. The OP had an issue with an older iPod working fine in his older BMW but not in the loaners.

IMHO, products become obsolete by the sheer pace of advances we have today. As technology improves, older items become obsolete simply because the majority abandon them and support resources need to be devoted to current technology. We can't slow down advances simply to support the last adopters."
720,dino001,November 2013,"I have no problem woth changing tech as long as the old one still works at least for a while. Three years is too short, something like six may be acceptable, especially at prices charged by both Apple and BMW. I do not accept premise that perfectly functioning $200 product should be tossed out so quickly for sake of new tech that does the same thing, like playing same music files at same quality. BTW, my Nano has up to date OS, which means it is the new 328 interface not accepting it.
2018 430i Gran Coupe"
721,graphicguy,November 2013,"I'm not so sure it's obsolescence, per se. But, I do think that the electronics aren't fully developed in cars to accept what has been a dizzying expansion of chips, PCBs, computers and software used to operate cars.

Amazing to me that the (using another acronym) ECU to precisely measure the exact amount of fuel required in each cylinder to maximize power and economy is amazing in and of itself. Overall, the car companies have that one nailed.

Another case in point, it's pretty amazing that most cars with the capability to tell the driver when his oil needs to be changed, based on sensors monitoring operating temp, mode of driving, etc, is equally amazing.

Where they fall down, is they don't put as much effort into understanding how the stereo is supposed to work with an iPod (probably the single most ubiquitous media device currently on the planet). Or, in Audi's case, how they can't even get CDs to play correctly. This, a technology that's been around for at least 30 years (and will probably be dead before the end of the decade).

It's not just Audi I'm picking on. I've heard wide spread reports of this from people who own GM cars, the issues with Ford's Sync, etc. Even my BMW E92 had stereo and NAV issues (minor in comparison to the Audi MMI), and that platform had been around for awhile.

My personal opinion, if you're going to be nonchalant about the electronics and features of your cars, don't put them in the car to begin with. They again, they appear to be ""behind the time"" if they don't have those features. So, they prefer to half-assed measures just so they can list a ""feature"" in marketing brochures.

One thing I have to do, is to tip my hat to the Japanese lux manufacturers. There's not one Acura, Lexus or Infiniti that I've been in that the tech hasn't worked the way it's supposed to. They put the effort and time in to make it work.

Speaking of which, just got off the phone with the Audi dealer. They still don't know what's wrong, but do have the MMI apart (assuming the dash is apart, as is the console since the MMI controller resides there). I inquired about the trans/Quattro binding issue. They haven't even begun that trouble shooting process. They did say the Audi ""rep"" is due to come in to look at my car. But, that's not until mid next week.

So, I'm still tooling around in their A6 2.0. While this is a nice car. It's not an Sx Audi vehicle. We had a dusting of snow this a.m. It did just fine. But, it's a big car. As good as the 4 cyl turbo is, (and it's really good), it's still hauling around a heavy car, and you feel it.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
722,sweendogy,November 2013,"That is the question? After a great run in the G- yes it's been 7 model years and 38k miles - my G finally gave me some trouble- the drivetrain belt (alternator belt?) shredded on the highway a few miles from work- was able to limp the car into the lot and had it towed to dealer for the 200bux repair. Made me think time for an upgrade? But then again it was only 200 bux to fix, but could this be the beginning of other more major issues to happen...I've never owned a car out of warrantee before- made me worry. Checked out the new q in the dealership, nice looking rig but the consumer reports article still rates the g higher. Plus they are not cheap and few deals around this far. 2 other options a cpo 335x (pre new body) or a cpo Audi s4. Both have great warranties - both great performers - but hearing the recent take on s4 issues has me worried, along with costs of course. Could wait a year and do the s3, sure is a looker - prob tops out around 50k - has enuf hp to an low end grunt- but can I wait- love hearing the experience thou from the masses."
723,markcincinnati,November 2013,"Although I wasn't as active a participant here (and elsewhere) whilst I had my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, I was a frequent reader of the postings and musings of those who participated those ""lonely"" 28 months.

I would not hesitate to recommend an Acura such as the one I had -- I would, however, try to put things into perspective for someone shopping for one of these ELLPS vehicles. The Acura was ______________ (fill in the blank with some mostly positive comments) and it remains an attractive car considering its price and (at the time) considering the fact that it is/was heavily discounted (13% off sticker in my case). I will still remember it as Acura's S4 (despite the fact that few would ever cross-shop the two cars).

If you're looking to enter into ELLPS land ""on the cheap"" I would say you can't do better than go for one of the current TL SH-AWD versions (the FWD version, however, does not qualify). However, in response to comments about Acura's ""tech/electronics"" working (apparently compared to Audi's MMI+), well I know it is a ""nit"" but the voice response software (at least in mine) would not function according to the owner's manual. I called Acura and took my car to the dealer (who had an Acura tech super user as a sales rep) -- both sources say the voice activation did have ""bugs"" in it. Moreover, when I asked Acura if there would be a fix, they said ""no updates are in the pipeline at this time.""

I have (remembering that I have had three different MMI cars since 2005) had my ""MMI OS"" -- what I would call ""windows for the car"" updated once on the 2005 and once on the 2009 -- and nothing so far on the 2014. I never had and still have never had any issues with my MMI+ equipped Audis. And, everything works.

On my Acura, for example, the car can have the voice activation system set to a REALLY annoying configuration where the voice system essentially mimics everything you say after you say it and before it does it. It can be turned off (same thing on my wife's 2011 Infiniti FX) -- when the voice prompt system is turned to ""minimalist"" mode, it is pretty easy to live with since it doesn't delay and doesn't parrot back your commands as if you might not really have meant what you asked of it. But, when in minimalist mode, functions (voice commands) that the manual says work . . .won't.

The Acura has no clock that is easy to locate at a glance. However, it has a feature that allows you to simply ask, out loud, ""what time is it?"" And, the voice system recites the correct time. I thought it was a fairly neat little command that I often used when I was alone in the car and, well, er -- SPEEDING. I could, without hunting on my wrist or the dash panel simply say ""what time is it?"" The system would comply and tell me the time of day.

However, this feature was ""disabled"" (and Acura said it should work regardless of the setting of the voice system to ""annoying"" mode) unless the voice response system was set to ""long mode"" (annoying mode).

Another annoying feature was the phone number input (by voice) which would inevitably put a zero in front of the number I was dialing -- or sometimes it would put a ""#"" sign and announce the character as ""POUND.""

Overall, the Acura system worked fairly well -- but there were more quirks in it than in any of my 3 Audis or my wife's tech package FX. Over the course of 28 months, I rarely used the voice command capability because it was either a little frustrating or annoying to use. MMI, by comparison is almost like ""natural language"" (almost).

The Infiniti system, too, rarely gets it wrong and doesn't require any time at all to learn to use.

The point, belabored for sure, is that I (a voice of one) found the Acura system ""more trouble than it was worth"" and also a system that wasn't nearly as intuitive as my wife's BMW (2008) or her 2011 Infiniti or any Audi I've had with the voice feature.

To each his/her own to be sure -- but I'm all for updating the tech systems on these cars ASAP and with as much frequency as it takes to get the bugs out. :surprise:

DILYL"
724,markcincinnati,November 2013,"I'm so far beyond biased, it makes everything I say possibly specious -- but I remain, after all, ""Often wrong, but NEVER uncertain"" -- but here goes:

Audi -- if you hold much stock in CR has moved up the ""reliability"" ratings with each passing year, arriving recently as the #4 ranked vehicle with respect to reliability. I would say that CR is good at the collecting of a good sized sample which makes them a very good resource for objective data (such as reliability and one would think durability, too.)

Generally speaking, ""everyone wants to be Audi"" -- or so says at least one or two ""Car & Driver"" type magazines when they wax poetic about auto brands in recent months.

Remarkably too, Audi's cars keep coming in close to the top or at the top of the heap in comparison tests. Most recently the A6 3.0T schooled its most worthy competition and even beat the new CTS (and the CTS's target was the BMW 5, which, in this case it did beat -- but so did the Mercedes in the test.)

Since everything does go in cycles, I would say, even with my considerable bias, ""this can't last."" Now is the time to make a move and get the Audi before it begins what -- eventually -- will be ""slippage."" Moreover, if you want something that has been modified and modified and slightly refreshed (last year) meaning it is perhaps the ""best one ever,"" I would think you would be hard pressed to build a better mousetrap than a 2014 A4 OR S4. Now, I may eat my words, but my '14 S4 is an absolute joy to drive. It is damn near a ""masterpiece.""

How I hope that the S4 may be tested (as was the BMW 3) against everyone's favorite newcomer -- the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport (my first choice in this class when I thought the S4 would be out of reach financially.)

In any case, the new Q50 seems to have missed the mark if you believe at least 3 auto enthusiast magazines and CR, so your choices are somewhat limited unless you want to re up for a new (last MY) G37X/Sport.

Now may be the time ""to Audi.""

But, like I said, I'm biased -- often wrong, just NOT uncertain.

Worse, it looks like BMW realized the driver's need to know exactly when to turn so engineers have thought of placing a bar on the monitor that gets shortened as you approach the turn 800ft-600ft-200ft. I tried and bitterly found out that it's pretty dangerous to glue my eyes to the monitor to follow the bar but if not, I'd miss the turn once in a while.

729,graphicguy,November 2013,"Thanks, FN. Having driven an A6, albeit one with the 4 cyl turbo, for 3 weeks, I can't disagree with any of the C&D assessments. In fairness, I haven't driven the new CTS, nor the new E350. I drove a 535i during the BMW drive event. And, I agree that it feels like a ponderous brick on the road (except, I too like the 3.0 Turbo motor, but more in a 3 series than the bigger, heavier 5).

I wish my issues with the S4 weren't so confounding. And, that Audi's efforts to fix it weren't so feeble. I might consider another Audi. As it stands, I'm going to battle with them.

730,robr2,November 2013,"...I saw at least 3 of them yesterday. In fact, I believe I saw more of them than 3's but I may be immune to noticing the latter since there are so many of them."
731,markcincinnati,November 2013,"Finally, finally, the SQ5 which we technically ordered before the S4 is in and ready to drive home.

We went ahead and took one ""on the boat"" so we ended up with an SQ5 Prestige with Magma Red leather and Panther Black paint ($1,075 option: OUCH!).

These two S cars are the quickest vehicles I have ever driven -- save for a Corvette I rented for a day for a friend's birthday. Now that I have 2,000 miles on the S4 it seems to be coming into that ""first wind"" that every Audi seems to get fully at about 5,000 miles and again around 10,000 miles.

My wife asked me to floor the S4 on an entrance ramp here on the I-275 loop that surrounds Cincinnati -- before I knew it, and before I even ran out of ramp, I was at 90mph. I had to slow down to merge for pity's sake.

Somehow the tuning of the SQ5's 8-speed Tiptronic seems to resemble the S-Tronic in the S4 pretty closely. The SQ5 shifts more often (duh!) and at full throttle makes those same fart sounds at shift points just like the S4.

Combining military grade power with luxury is no mean feat -- but Audi has done it again with the SQ5. We even test drove a Cayenne (which costs more) and it didn't have the power and urge of the SQ5. It seems to get this much power in a Cayenne you have to resign yourself to a 6 figure purchase. We got my wife's SQ5 at 6% off sticker plus $1,000 loyalty bonus.

The S cars will look pretty cool sitting in the garage, too: hers is black and mine is white.

We went ahead and got the 20"" Audi OE inch wheels (it came with 21""'s which you can't get all season UHP tires in the correct size) and we had the dealer take off the stock summer only tires and replaced them with new Continental Extreme Performance DWS UHP A/S's.

733,flightnurse,November 2013,"So I guess Audi hasn't fixed your issues with your car.

In regards to the CTS, I was in Ft Lauderdale and San Diego this week and at National Car Rental I spoke to the manager of both locations and was told they are expecting the new 2014 CTS by Jan.. So once I get one I'll post what I think. I had a 2014 ATS Performance in San Diego. Even though the ATS ""handles"" better then the 3 series, I liked the overall ""package"" that the 3 series offers. The ATS is too small for my liking, this was the issue I had with my 328i.

735,markcincinnati,November 2013,"Andres3 -- wait until you get over 1,000 miles on the OD; at that mileage the power improves and the fuel consumption drops. I did notice a slight decrease in the oil level (on the MMI screen), but the indicator still says ""OK.""

If this is your first Audi, you will be getting 2 new ones in the future. Your ""second"" new Audi will come to your garage (at no extra charge) at 5,000 miles (or so) and then you will find yet another new Audi at 10,000 miles. Now, I say this never having had an Audi supercharged engine, but every other Audi I've ever had (4, 5, 6 or 8 cylinder, naturally aspirated or forced induction) repeated the ""rebirth"" at the noted mileage. Never had the same experience with the various Acura, Infiniti or BMW's we have had over the years.

WE almost always do this: ""I wish"" I had configured the sport differential on my order; ""I wish"" 19"" wheels with A/S UHP tires were offered as an option; ""I wish"" the tracking headlights were offered on the P+ S4 (like are on my wife's new Prestige SQ5); and I wish the A/S tires were not simply Grand Touring models, but UHP's like we put on the SQ5 (Continental DSW's). But, even without my wish list, this is (these two cars -- my S4 and her SQ5 are) the best Audis ever, AND my (and my wife's) most favorite cars -- ever.

Every time I push the start button, put the car in dynamic mode (which actually the car ""remembers"" from the first time) and take off, I am impressed by the seemingly intuitive transmission and the sense of an almost unlimited well of horsepower and torque. Now that I have 2,000 miles on mine, I am unafraid to floor the accelerator, and find it to be an absolute rush every time I do.

Lets us know YOUR driving impressions as you: Drive It Like You Live."
736,flightnurse,December 2013,"So I haven't been traveling so much for work, out of state (that is), but have been working in Tucson. On my trips down and back, I have been averaging 36 MPG, this is doing anywhere between 55-80. The traffic between these cities have gotten really back over the years. Before you could set the cruise at 80 and just go.

So for thanksgiving, I went over to San Diego to see my dad, I-10 west, through Palm Spring, Riverside, and down the I-15 to San Diego. Weather was clear, temps in the mid to high 60s for most of the trip, no A/C needed. Average speed was 75, I averaged 38.5 MPG (car trip computer), however, when I filled up the car took 12 gallons at 460 miles (38.3 mpg), on the way home, temps in the upper 70's to low 80's A/C average speed 80, 37.5 mpg (cars trip computer), 465 miles used 12.5 gallons which is 37.2 mpg. So the car's trip computer is fairly accurate in the MPG.

So a few thoughts on this car, I have 3800 miles on it (much higher then I thought I would have) but this is the nature of my work.

1) The start/stop feature, it is unnerving when you first get in the car and it stops. You get the WTF just happened. Now having the car for 2 months, it is second nature, doesn't bother me at all.

2) Power, the car is rated at ""only"" 180 hp, but in my daily driving and highway cruising, the power band and torque are set that one would be hard pressed to tell, my last rental was a 2014 Sonata, and while the standard engine make about 200hp, the 320i ""felt faster"" then the Sonata's. BTW, I just ordered the Stage 1 tuning kit for the 320, 30hp gain and 40 lbs of torque gain for $375. stage 2 is in beta test but from the prelim testing, on a 320i stage two add's another 20 hp and 30 lbs of torque for another $175. MPG is not to be affected at all with these upgrades under normal driving (well see about that.)

3) Handling and ride of the new F30 I read people's comments about the steering feel of the new F30, granted it does have the weighted feel of the E90 or the current 1 series and X1, but in daily driving one is really hard pressed to know the lack of feedback. I'm sure on the track it is a completely different story. The ride of the non-sport F30 is typical German, well controlled without it being too harsh, now, my E90 with the M sport pack and run flat tires wasn't so bad if the road was smooth, but as we all know, not many cities have ultra smooth road, and that combo get's tiresome after a while. Do I wish for better supportive seats, YES, but over all, no real complaints. I was not tired at all on my trip to San Diego, my first stop is always just north palm spring which takes about 4 hours to get, no sore butt or fatigue at all.

Has BMW last some of the edge that the 3 series had, yes, BMW was always more of a ""sport"" sedan, then a ""luxury"" sedan but the people with the money (buyers) want more luxury which is fine, but I think BMW can make both sides happy without really compromising too much, I just hope they find the happy medium.

Some grips about what has become of the 3 series, when building a new 3 series, the only two interior color one can get with the sport pack is black or red. If you want other colors you have to get the M sport pack, Luxury model or standard. I wish the enhanced bluetooth and alarm was standard.

With that being said, I like the 320i, it does want I want it to do, the price was reasonable and the resale value of the 320i seems to high on it, but time will tell."
737,graphicguy,December 2013,"Nice write up FN. Sounds like a very good car.

I know when I had mine, I thought the power was way under rated (at least from what BMW claimed). Sounds like they did the same with the 320i. I had the performance pack installed on mine for an extra 20 HP. Well worth the money.

Maybe the 320i is the spiritual successor to the 2002ti.

Specs look pretty wicked. I like it.

Any idea on pricing? I was thinking if things keep going with the S4 the way they've been goind, I might be interested in the 235i M. But, this looks quite interesting, too.

I also agree with you that the 2 series M looks very nice, if the price could be kept under 50K I think BMW would have a major hit on their hands.

Major reason for the Twin Turbo 6

better MPG, BMW wont meet the CAFE that is set by our government, also driveability, the out going V8, thought nice, was really a dog in normal driving, from the reports of this new engine, one can drive it like a normal BMW in town and it wont have problems, the greater torque of the 6 will also allow BMW to get better MPG..."
742,graphicguy,December 2013,"Thanks FN....Do you know when the 235 M is supposed to hit the streets?

I think the $55K is the top end of my price threshhold. That means, the M3 is probably not going to be on my list. Matter of fact, I'd love to come in well under $50K. I'd stretch it if I was really bowled over by a car, but I'm fairly familiar with what's out there in those price ranges and feel confident I'm not going to get bowled over.

744,markcincinnati,December 2013,"I had sent this ""privately"" and now I figure what the heck -- perhaps there is some merit in these remarks for others, too.
At $55,000 (net), you can easily get into a well-optioned 2014 Audi S4 Premium Plus. Clearly I don't know what would impress you -- and if this Audi doesn't do it for you, you can load up a IS 350 F-Sport and at full MSRP be @ less than $51,000. Of course of the two noted above, the S4 is the real performer with its sweet supercharged V6.
The torque steer is something to overcome in the Volvo S60 T6 (Type R) but it is tough to get this car OVER $50,000. It may not do it for you due to the obvious FWD bias, but it is worth a test-drive if you're in the market at this dollar amount.
So, while $55K won't get us into the SUPERCAR realm, we do have a number of choices that will stay under this price cap. It's a great time to be in the market (the $50K+ market) if you ax' me.

745,graphicguy,December 2013,"Mark...I replied privately, at least that's what I thought with the new Forums now in place.
Don't get me wrong, I think the S4 is one of the best 4 door sports sedans on the market, regardless of price. But, mine has been very trouble prone (it's sitting at the dealership yet again right now).
The Chicago Regional Rep, took over communications from the dealer I purchased it from. And, he's supposed to be in communication with the local dealer. I think the local dealer is just as frustrated with the local Audi Regional Rep as I am.
We're well over the ""30 day"" rule of the car being out of commission. So, I think they're all huddling, trying to decide the next step to take.
I'll wait to see what they do. So far, everyone except the local Audi Regional Rep have been great to work with.
I ""think"" I know which diretion this will end up, but you never know. That said, if they do end up ""lemon"" lawing my car, I'll obviously be in a scramble to get something else. What that is, I really don't know.
Ray...I do like that 235i M. But, I doubt that will be in my time bracket if they do a buy back.
I may make a little trip around this weekend looking at different cars, just for kicks.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
746,markcincinnati,December 2013,"I have, in this forum, shared my experiences with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I did suggest that I understood and largely agreed with the July '10 Automobile comparison of a TL (SH-AWD) with an Audi S4 (with the sport differential – Audi's torque vectoring rear diff).
Refresher (from Automobile, July 2010): “You probably never thought of the Acura TL SH-AWD and the Audi S4 on the same day, much less in the same sentence. . . .significantly, they both use torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive systems to ensure that they don't sacrifice one iota of the corner-carving thrills you've grown to love.”
“In a [non-permissible content removed]-for-tat comparison between two cars that share the same driveline philosophy, it quickly becomes obvious that the Acura and the Audi are significantly different only in the details.”
Now, with 3,000+ miles on my '14 S4 and after 40,000+ miles with my TL, I can offer my 2¢ more.
First, let’s get the “as owned “ MSRP’s out there. With rear parking sensors, upgraded tires (UHP a/s's) and splash guards, the TL SH-AWD Advance comes in a bit south of $48,000. Approximately comparably equipped (but sans the sport differential) the S4 Premium+ easily sweeps past $57,000, coming in at $57,650 (without Premium paint, which could have added additional $, had I selected one of the many optional colors offered.) My '12 Acura came with the color called Bellanova White Pearl while the Audi I configured was in a glossy hue they call Ibis White. A metallic white option on the Audi would have added another $550 to the MSRP.
If you’re keeping score, the Audi starts out about $10,000 more than the Acura similarly contented. But simply saying they have similar content somehow makes the Audi seem expensive, a perspective I have come to believe is untrue. As the Automobile review declares, “[they] are significantly different only in the details.” Never a truer statement was said about these two cars. And, please, don’t for a minute think that somehow this is a knock on the Acura.
Indeed, considering its performance & content, the TL SH-AWD Advance_ is_ rather a bargain (and I mean what I say only about the SH-AWD Advance version – what I say should not suggest I would make these remarks about other TL configurations). Perhaps were I given the opportunity to test a TL with both SH-AWD and the manual transmission, I would change my opinion.
The Audi is neither over-priced nor is it a bargain – but, considering its price, it is unlikely you will find the S4’s luxury content and performance envelope replicated without spending thousands more. The current heart-throb car, the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, offers a very high contented, audaciously styled machine to be sure, but its performance isn’t up to the S4’s; in fairness, however, an F-Sport even over loaded with optional stuff, will have trouble breaking the $50,000 MSRP barrier.
There is, currently, no BMW 3-series M car (if you don’t include the 3-series” M” convertible, starting at $69,050, which I am not counting) – and if there were, it too would easily sail through a $65,000 price; besides, the comparison to the S4 would be incorrect, the BMW M would be more accurately compared to an RS – not S – Audi car.
Back to the TL vs the S4. Both cars do what they do well – at their respective price points. The Acura – subjectively – may well represent/possess over 90% of the Audi’s performance. And, for the money asked, the Acura remains perhaps one of the biggest bargains today in the ELLPS category (assuming you can get over the exterior – and for some, the interior – styling).
Here is what you get for your extra $10,000+ in the Audi S4: a palpable sense that anything and everything you want the car to do is effortless. From the S-Tronic’s apparent ability to read the driver’s mind, to an incredibly deep bucketful of power that is always ready a ¼ of a second before you ask for it, to an ability to corner that approaches violating the laws of physics, the S4 almost becomes an extension of the driver’s mind, rather like Green Lantern’s power-ring, I suspect.
In contrast, the TL SH-AWD is not quite as much the natural athlete as the S4 – although it has nothing to be ashamed of, it’s just that to get 90% of the S4’s performance out of the TL, you have to work at it. Here’s one reason why: the TL’s well of torque isn’t as deep as the Audi’s and the TL’s torque doesn’t reach full-boil until significantly higher RPM’s (the TL's V6 is naturally aspirated vs the S4's supercharged V6). The consequences of less torque attained at higher RPM’s twisting through 6 (automatic) gears are not subtle – the Acura must be kept “cranked up” to get the most out of it. While doing this can be pretty rewarding, it is hardly effortless.
Another huge disadvantage the TL has is its 6 speed traditional (it uses a torque converter) automatic transmission. The Audi’s 7-speed direct shift (twin-clutch) transmission by comparison feels as if the smoothest stick shift driver ever is selecting the perfect time for upshifts and downshifts. Coming to a stop, the Audi’s transmission downshifts both at the appropriate time but also with incredible precision and smoothness that I doubt any one of us contributors here could even come close to.
In the final analysis, the 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance is a lot of car for the money – and I would still call it Acura’s S4. For $47,000+ there isn’t much – if anything – that comes close to the content and performance offered (if you can get past its unique styling and busy button-laden cockpit.) I had mine 40,000+ miles over less than a 30 month time period and other than what I assumed were weak brakes (the rotors were turned twice before 25K miles before the dealer determined the problem was three warped wheels which Acura replaced – at a 50% discount to me), the Acura would certainly seem to be well on its way to living up to its reputation for reliability – but at only 40,000 miles I assume most cars on the market today would still seem young.
The 2014 S4 presumably produces performance numbers that bests the TL in almost every category, but for an additional $10,000 it ought to. The S4 does seem more substantive than the TL – of course you only really notice this aspect when you slam the doors or hit a pot-hole or find yourself on a “washboard” road surface. The Acura’s body seems to be of a thinner metal than the Audi, the TL's suspension upon rapid compression or over undulating surfaces seems on the verge of being brittle where the Audi, under similar circumstances, seems to absorb and rebound from rough surfaces with aplomb.
If you’re looking for the TL to buy you much – if any – street cred from your buds, don’t count on it. Virtually everyone I know called my TL, “Mark’s Honda.” Truth be told, the main problem with the Acura – for me – was that it simply had “too much Honda” in it. Some years ago, Audis were sometimes said to have “too much VW” in them – regardless of the truth, the perception was sufficient, apparently, to motivate Audi to separate themselves as much as they could from VW. Thus far, Acura’s are often thought of as “Honda’s who know somebody.”
More’s the pity, for the TL (at least) is a kind of “almost” car – it is almost many things: almost a luxury car, almost a sporty car – i.e., almost an LPS car. I can recommend the TL SH-AWD Advance for its likely street price (I got mine at nearly 13% off); the car is comfortable, well contented and highly competent at most, if not all, of the things we ask for in a premium vehicle.
It didn’t inspire much passion and, frankly, didn’t seem to actually have been built to be passionate. The S4 inspires and it has passion – its “fun to drive factor,” which seems to be priced at about $10,000, has been abundantly imbued by its creators. Even after a crappy day, driving the S4 puts a smile on my face.
That’s my story . . . and . . you know.

747,hercules00,December 2013,"Infiniti has done many, many things to destroy its bread and butter - the awesome G37 - with the new Q50. The list of things is endless, from destroying what was likely the best handling vehicle in its class to a ridiculous dual touchscreen interior.
For the sake of argument, let us say there was some logic behind those moves - some new audience that legacy G drivers like me (and almost all reviewers) do not understand.
But can anyone explain why Infiniti felt the need to dump the G's trademark double-circular taillight arrangement to replicate the taillights of the Sonata? Was it their way of going 'upscale'?
Sonata
Q50"
748,carnaught,December 2013,"I don't know. I don't see it that way. To me the Q50 looks more updated and upscale. The G, although handsome, was getting old."
749,markcincinnati,December 2013,"I agree with the comments about the beauty of the new Q50. I think it is very handsome on the outside and both inside and out it seems more upscale befitting its inclusion with its competition from Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Lexus & Mercedes to name a few.
The issues with the Q50 seem NOT to be with its comeliness, rather with its steering feel or lack thereof. Other critiques seem to remind the reader that the 3.7L normally aspirated engine -- while somewhat more sound isolated in the Q50 -- is ""coarse"" and that the 7-speed transmission is a carryover.
Now, having just turned in our 2011 FX35 after 60,000 miles, I would say even if there were no improvements in the transmission in the Q50, that it is a fine transmission. Likewise, the 3.7L engine is powerful even if not particularly blessed with an abundance of torque. After driving the new Q50, the ""thrash"" and coarseness often attributed to this engine has been muted significantly, but, this mill isn't up to the smoothness of the German 6-cylinder engines and one wonders why Infiniti hasn't noticed (apparently) that forced induction engines are the currently favored configuration.
Overall, the Infiniti (at least this first venture out with the new Q50) seems unlikely to be finishing as the top choice against its German and Japanese competitors. I assume Infiniti was shooting to be the darling of the ELLPS set, but came up short compared to the Lexus IS 350 [F Sport, especially].
From a styling perspective, I find the Q50 to be handsome; it looks expensive. The IS 350 is, well, ""edgy"" with its audacious styling and spindle grill. The IS looks like it would be sporty (to me, at least), whereas the Q50's style might well be more enduring since -- compared to the IS -- it is more conservative, less in-your-face. Here's something, too, the ATS -- right out of the gate -- seems to have gotten a lot MORE right than the Q50, despite what many could have assumed was a head-start what with the Q50 coming from such good stock (the G37X).
Now, at least here in Cincinnati, the Q50 seems to be subvented and discounted so heavily, that they ought to be flying out of the showroom. I have never seen one on the road (other than near the dealership where they are obviously being test-driven.
This is pretty amazing, considering that I have seen the outrageously priced Audi RS 7 -- a car so rarified that I actually wouldn't consider not seeing it as indicative of anything. Not once seeing a Q50 is -- speaking as a fan of the brand -- well, sad.
Hopefully Johan de Nysschen, the new Infiniti president, will be able to imbue future Infinitis with some of the Audi Magic he most certainly picked up on over his 19 years with Audi.
Well, there's always next year -- I'd look for some under-the-covers changes for the Q50, sooner rather than later. But I could be wrong, just not uncertain.

752,markcincinnati,December 2013,"I nearly cracked up when I read your comment, CD, that my wife and I were ""slumming"" with her Infiniti and my Acura. I guess your equating both our return to Audis (or German cars in general) to the ""economy"" is perhaps somewhat (or more than somewhat) true, too.
Yet, to be more transparent, I think it is also acccurate to say that the Japanese cars we had were (quoting my wife: ""passionless"") even though they were worthy of being described as ""premium"" class.
I had so wanted the Q50 to be what its advanced press promised; and, if you'll recall, I custom ordered an IS 350 F Sport in Ultra White with a red leather interior, AWD and a bunch of options. When my wife ordered a Q5 3.0T, I tes drove the S4 and thought it to be ""beyond reach"" even though it was clearly able to outperform the IS in every way (including price.)
The Audi dealer somehow came up with a lease price that made switching my plans and coming ""home"" to Audi a no brainer. So yea, the economy observation does ring true, but not the whole story.
Regarding the length of my posts, well, I once again have something to go on about.
I do urge anyone even thinking about the cars under discussion here to include a test drive of an S4; you may find, as did I, that an S4 is ""within reach.""

Infiniti's strong point in this segment with the Q50 are stunning good looks and gobs of power at a very reasonable price. The 3.7L VQ most definitely will not be as smooth as the German sixes.

2001 Prelude Type SH, 2022 Highlander XLE AWD, 2022 Wrangler Sahara 4Xe"
755,graphicguy,January 2014,"Someone asked for a compare/contrast with the new TL SH AWD and the previous one I had, in addition to a comparison to the S4. I just can't remember which thread asked for the post, so putting it here.
I'll get this out of the way up front so ""markincincinnati"" doesn't raise his blood pressure. The S4 drives better, no question. In some areas, it's significantly better, in other areas just a smidgeon better. Then there are areas where the TL SH AWD is better.
First, the difference between my former 4G TL SHA AWD and this one. The new one is smoother. There's no trans ""shifting"" feeling going on. My old one had the 5 speed auto. The new one, a 6 speed. I think the ratios are closer together which might account for the smoothness. And, I believe the 6th gear has a taller ratio than the old one. One tank of gas in, 50-50 driving, I got 23 MPG. Plenty acceptable. That's about 10% better than the old TL and about the same amount better than the S4.
So, I like the new trans in the TL. It's not as good as the DSG 7 speed in the S4. But, it is better than the one in the previous. Again, smooth with good manual control via the paddle shifters. The S4 will bang gears with the best of them, automatic or manual, no ifs, ands or buts.
The S4 is fast, without a doubt. It's probably the fastest sports sedan I've ever driven, and will rival many muscle cars. The TL is quick. It has plenty of power, especially once you get around the 3K RPM range where the torque kicks in. The S4 has torque all over the range rev. The new 6 speed in the TL makes it feel quicker than the old one. Again, different gear ratios.
Handling-the TL is FWD based, even though it has the torque vectoring tick going on (as did the S4). So, there is a difference between the S4 and the SH AWD of the TL. Not as much as you might expect, though. They're really close in the handling dept. I find myself sometimes saying, ""I liked the S4 better"". At other times I find myself saying (""the TL SH AWD is as good as the S4, and also more forgiving""). Tough to choose one over the other.
Ride-this goes to the new TL. I think Acura has out BMWd BMW with the ride/handling compromise. Acura must have recalibrated the suspension in some way. It's firm without being uncomfortable. Where the S4 sometimes crashes over bumps in the road, the TL absorbs them without drama.
Seat comfort goes to the TL. They were, and continue to be some of the best sports seats in any car I've ever driven. They're snug without pinching (something the S4's seats sometimes do).
Fit and finish is a tie. The old TL, the new TL and the S4 are all exemplary in fit and finish. However, as with the old TL, everything in the new TL just works the way it's supposed to. That's a far cry from what I experienced with the S4. All electronics work. There's no in car internet in the TL, but I let the uber expensive in car internet lapse in the S$ because it was slow, and unneeded. Since I did let it lapse in the S4, some of the NAV maps went bonkers (next to no information about the roads being displayed on the NAV). On the TL, it's straight forward, accurate and detailed.
As good as the B&O stereo was in the S4, the system in the TL (ELS) is better. It's simply one of the best factory sound systems on the market, in any car.
Styling, as always, is subjective. I liked the look of the older TL. I like the look of my new one better. I'm way in the minority here, though. The S4 is classic Audi with the LCD daytime running lights that everyone seems to like these days. I liked the look of the S4, too.
Here's where markincinnati and I will part. I had the check from Audi buying back my S4. I pocketed around $14K and got the new TL SH AWD Advance...as loaded as you can get one.
Is the S4 better? As I started, some ways yes, other ways no. Is it $14K better? Not even close...not even $10K better, and I'd have to try really, really hard to make a case that it's $5K better.
Don't get me wrong. Both are really good cars. If you're looking to blow people's doors off at stop lights, while having a good handling 4 door, the S4 is for you.
If you want something more well rounded, that does a lot of things well, the TL is for you (just don't go seeking any Mustang GTs down at a stop light...wait until you get into the corners).

Great write up. You did an exemplary job at comparing thoroughly & objectively.
2001 Prelude Type SH, 2022 Highlander XLE AWD, 2022 Wrangler Sahara 4Xe"
759,markcincinnati,January 2014,"graphicguy - when I first came to the ""economic"" realization, in 2011, that I would feel the prudent choice for my next car (out of a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige) would not be another Audi (a new A4 to replace the '09 would have been about $100+ more per month and the lease term 6 months longer), I tested many brands.
The 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance seemed like a good choice since it most reminded me of an Audi (and specifically it reminded me more of an S4 than an A4 2.0T with sport package.) I had read a 2010 Automobile Magazine comparison report of the S4 and TL which did say most folks would probably never cross shop the two cars, but overall, the TL SH-AWD was favorably reviewed even though it was ""out-gunned"" and out-priced by the S4.
I find myself more in violent agreement with your thoughts than any other perspective. Your recent experience with an S4 certainly has made you come by your observations and opinions honestly. Indeed, your overview was balanced.
The most subjective part of many purchases we make is typically ""value"" -- some folks will value an ""extra 10%"" sufficiently to allow them to cost-justify a 25% (or more in some cases) price difference. This is true in cars, clothes, food and seat choices at sporting events (to name just a few).
The S4's creators, as I noted, seems to ""cost"" fun-to-drive at about $10,000 over the TL SH-AWD Advance. Today, I see the S4 as being worth the premium. In 2011, I could not cost-justify such a price delta.
Bang for the buck does go to the Acura. I am thinking, too, that there are other high bang for the buck offerings available from Korea -- at the same time, I am also thinking the new Cadillac CTS is a lower value proposition than the previous generation CTS. Clearly these preferences are highly subjective.
Objectively (or as objectively as possible), the Acura can be evaluated as having greater content per dollar than the Audi. Although more subjective in nature, I believe it is probable that any collection of ""professional"" reviewer's opinions about the two cars would reveal these reviewers to find the S4 more praise-worthy. Objective (measured) test results, too, would probably show the Audi's performance to be higher than the Acuras -- even if often only slightly thus.
It all comes down to ""how much"" it is worth to you to have one vs the other. No such comparison is possible, given the 5-figure price difference between the two vehicles, but I wonder which car would be ""chosen"" if they were priced virtually identically and identically contented.
I assume if the choice of a new loaded TL SH-AWD or a new loaded S4 were presented, and both had an asking price of $47,500, that the S4 would be chosen more frequently (the vast majority of the time.)
Can't prove this, of course, but it would make for an interesting study of ""perceived value.""
Today, therefore, I'll agree that the TL SH-AWD Advance offers a very high value; but, I will also -- today -- pay the upcharge for the S4 and attribute that price difference to the cost of the ""fun-to-drive"" factor.
DILYL -- with the emphasis on ""you""!"
760,graphicguy,January 2014,"Mark...as always...appreciate your insight.
At the end of the day, that's the reason there are so many choices, particularly in the ELLPS sliver of the market.
Competition keeps all of these vehicles we discuss smack in the middle of what I consider some of the most desireable cars on the road. They are certainly among the most capable cars you can drive...probably in any of the individual brands' line up.
Long and short of it, there's no wrong answer here.
Since I'm fresh off of test drives, it's clear where some of these manufacturers are going. BMW, for reasons that befuddle me, are softening up their cars. I suspect most will like that. Personally, I don't. But, looks like it's helping them sell more cars. Same can be said for the Infiniti Q, although that softening doesn't seem to be helping them whatsoever in selling the new Q50. Shame.
Benz is going for high style. I saw pics of the new C class, and drove the CLA. I'm guessing the new C will drive similarly to the old C. Nothing compelling there. CLA shows Benz trying to become the style leader while offering run of the mill driving dynamics. Seems to be working for them as they just surpassed BMW as the U.S. luxury car sales leader. Not my cup 'o tea, but they've been successful with that strategy.
Audi keeps marching to their own beat. Good for them for doing it. To me, they are the performance leaders. Owning the S4, and having had A6s for extended periods of time as loaners, I can't fathom another manufacturer doing more to imbue their cars with fun to drive characteristics (reliability needs lots of work, though)
If there's one place Acura has fallen down, it's in the style dept. They've got the engineering down. Their performance is competitive, their operation, build and reliability are rock solid. I don't hold out much hope that the upcoming TL(X) will be substantially different from the RLX is style. I like it, most don't. That said, it does feel good to just have such a capable car do everything well, without worry of hiccups.
Wish I could think of a pithy saying to close with. Can't. So, thanks for the input....will have to suffice.

I think the 1.8L is reserved for Europe only. Base engine is 2.0L. And yes, I agree, the V6 would be the way to go here.

Looking forward to the new Jag models that are (hopefully) in the near future pipeline, especially the 3/A/C competitor model. While I'm enjoying the XF more and more each day, and it doesn't feel/drive as big and heavy as I know it is, I would have much preferred a slightly tidier package.

The board is definitely livening up a bit again. I like it. Infiniti's strong point in this segment with the Q50 are stunning good looks and gobs of power at a very reasonable price. The 3.7L VQ most definitely will not be as smooth as the German sixes. I would say Infiniti's V6 is smoother than BMW's N20 2.0 Turbo 4.
I wondered what happened to the forum, since I stopped getting message, I see a whole new look..
Since having my 320i now for 3 months, I can say that the smoothness is an issue, but since I have upgraded the ECU to the stage one, the extra power has really transformed the car. The harshness doesn't bother me at all, The 320 still have the feel of a BMW, the only positive that the Q50 has is the VQ engine, but that engine has it's issues too."
777,flightnurse,January 2014,"@graphicguy said:
Thanks FN. Interesting that BMW went with the double turbo 3.0 instead of the usual V8s they've used in the past.
Specs look pretty wicked. I like it.
Any idea on pricing? I was thinking if things keep going with the S4 the way they've been goind, I might be interested in the 235i M. But, this looks quite interesting, too.
Price for the new M 3/4 has not been set, but the speculations are starting about 57K. The idea of the twin turbo 6 has to do with the CAFE numbers, but since the 320, 328i and 328d are all exceeding their EPA rating, we might see more fun cars from BMW...
Like you graphic, the M235i has caught my eye, for under 50K you can get yourself a car that is really a M2 (full M suspension, and other go fast items) with the turbo 6 with the performance pack standard. And with the huge aftermarket for that turbo six the sky is really the limit. Rick really likes the 320i, so I might be able to talk him into using his car on a trade in for the M235i..."
778,nyccarguy,January 2014,"@flightnurse
Glad you (and presumably Rick too) are happy with your 320i. My car is in for service and I got a brand spankin new 2014 328xd. This is the 3rd new body style 3 series I've driven. BMW seems to be trying (operative word here) to inject some of its ""ultimate driving machine"" magic more and more. I actually like the new 3er more and more as a commuter. While the steering is still too vague for my tastes, the ride is comfortable & taut, the 8 speed automatic is well matched to both the 4cyl gasser & 4cyl diesel.
The diesel is a bit harsher than the 4cyl gas 320i & 328i. As expected, mid range torque is fantastic, but the most impressive thing of all is the diesel's fuel economy. A green engine (the car had 9 miles on it when I picked it up) is showing between 39 & 40 mpg average. Literally almost double what I get with my 2011 328xi.

Over on Bimmerfest people are posting 50 mpg (highway) on trips with a relatively ""green"" engine. and as the engine loosens up more the mpg will increase too. For a commuter car the 328d is really one of best cars to get, it is comfortable, can carry 4 adults without problems, and get the same and or better MPG then so called economy cars. People are posting some incredible lease deal they are getting on them too. A base 328d, with heated seats and moonroof, MSRP 41K, sale price 37K, Minus $750 built credit, $1000 USAA credit, $1000 BMWCC credit, and the killer part they are added 7 MSDs (Multi Security Deposits) out of pocket was $3750 36m/12K/yr payment are $365/m + tax. At the end of lease the $3750 will come back to them. The MSD are a hidden gem in the BMW lease deals...Granted you have to have the money to do, but if you do they are a great deal..."
780,markcincinnati,January 2014,"The new Acura TLX (and the press release comments) give me hope for the brand. I am going to assume the engineers and designers at Acura have banished as much of the ""Honda Effect"" as possible. I see no harm in some power train sharing, for example, but Acura needs to be a brand that stands out as a Brand, not just an upscale Honda.
For years (and I know since I owned examples of both brands), it was quite easy to see the resemblance and lineage of Audi and VW. I assume it was Audi who made the decision to ""go their own way"" not the other way around. The result has been beneficial to both brands.
The new Q50 (recently reviewed -- and not all that favorably -- on MotorWeek) got the style right as far as I am concerned. The 3.7L engine has been made to feel much smoother and the interior is more upscale befitting Infiniti's aspirations. Thus far, however, the reviews of the Q50 have been, well, underwhelming. I suspect the driving dynamics that the experts loved in the G37 will need to return and be improved upon sooner rather than later.
The IS from Lexus -- in IS 350 F Sport trim -- seems to have gotten everything right, not so much however the lesser IS's, especially the 250 which has recently been given mostly ""thumb's down.""
Now, along comes Acura with what appears to be a sparkling, spanky new TL(X). Acura, for the past few years, has been apparently wandering aimlessly (with the exception of the MDX, one of Acura's 'reasons for being') -- are they a Premium car-line or are they drifting further away with each passing year (a halo car, which is looking good, ain't enough to redeem them, yet). This new TLX is, from the web pictures a looker -- and the marketing message is pretty darn strong. Like the Q50 and the IS 350 F Sport, however, the proof will be when the automotive press gets their hands on the thing in several states of trim.
Despite my ""one and done"" Acura TL SH-AWD flirtation and my subsequent return to Audi (with an S4 none the less), I did think the Acura was a decent attempt at creating an ELLPS; I still think the 2012 and newer Acura TL SH-AWD models were Acura's S4, and a high value vehicle, too.
So, here's hoping Acura's glintzy (a made up word) new TLX lives up to our expectations as well as its press release. As Van Morrison said (adapted here to mean ""These are the days to be in the market for a new ELLPS""):
""These are the days, the time is now
There is no past, there's only future
There's only here, there's only now.""
Get 'em while they're hot.
And, drive it like you live."

783,markcincinnati,January 2014,Michaell - Cool. Edited! Thanks!
784,dash5,January 2014,"I'm with Mark on the new TLX. It's definitely on my list of ""must try"" as of now. Of course that is pending reviews. As far as looks though, great. The talk is all right on track for me too: performance, quiet cabin, tech.
It's still got plenty of hurdles to clear though. I'm picky with interiors. I love Audi in that regard. I certainly prefer Honda/Acura to Toyota/Lexus interiors, but we will see what we get here.
On top of that they will be contending with the upcoming A3 sedan and the CLA. I'm glad to see this new class being competitive!"
785,stickguy,January 2014,"that spy shot of the TLX did look sharp. Not worried about the interior. They seem to have been doing a good job there.
I am curious to see what they do for powertrain. Since it is replacing the TL and TSX, will they go with a 4/6/hybrid? Turbo something?
Will also be nice if it frees up the ILX for a power boost. Basically use the 2.4l on a mid-level AT model, not just the ""hot rod'. That IMO will make it a much more desirable option since it will be plenty quick. Keep the 2.0l for the base car, and have the 2.4 as the upgrade.
2020 Acura RDX tech SH-AWD, 2023 Maverick hybrid Lariat luxury package."
786,markcincinnati,January 2014,"The SH-AWD version will have the 3.5L V6 and a 9-speed dual clutch transmission, at least I think it said dual clutch (the 9-speed I am sure of).
My 2012 TL had a 3.7L V6 rated at 305 HP -- which, these days is close to being too little (unless there is a big torque number that comes on at relatively low RPM's). I would assume Acura has goosed things appropriately all the way around.
With respect to the interior -- well, most folks did not and do not seem to make favorable comments about the ""button-happy"" interior and steering wheel. Once I got used to things, it never really bothered me, but the 2012 interior was not what I would call ""premium"" -- it seemed like, well, TOO MUCH Honda Accord DNA had seeped into it.
Looking at the Audi interiors often spoils [most] people for others interior treatments. I count myself as one of those so spoiled.
I am, however, confident, that Acura will probably get the interior right this time. But wait -- it is probably going to be very much like the RLX, which has been recently criticized for still being too busy."

I believe Acura was pretty early to the 300+ HP V6 party. I know my Mustang GT SOHC V8 had 300 HP less than 10 years ago. BMW is still touting their twin scroll turbo 6 as 300 HP (albeit I suspect that's under rated). The Lexus (x)S 350 V6 is right at that mark, too. The Infiniti V6 in the Q/G sedans have more HP, but are down on torque compared to the Acura V6.
Audi uses a S/C on their 6 cyl, and is a great performer. Their 4 cyl is 220HP but is torquey.
So, I think Acura is dead on if they end up with a 210-230 HP 4 cyl and a 310-320 HP V6. Again, 8 sp DCT or 9 sp transmissions put them right at the front of the class, too.
Mark, I don't think Acura gives up anything to the Audi's interior in materials, build, or functionality. Like you, I've owned both. Still say the ELS sound system in the current TL trumps the B&O system in the S4.
I'm into my new TL for at least 2-3 more years. After that, I'll be in my Acura store first visit of any shopping trip.

About the F80 M3 and F82 M4
The all-new BMW M3 Sedan and first-ever BMW M4 Coupe are examples of the legendary BMW M engineering which emphasizes a synthesis of motorsport technology with unrestricted daily driving versatility. World-class engine and powertrain technologies, along with intelligent lightweight vehicle construction through extensive use of exotic construction materials, add to the intensity of the M feeling and driving experience. The extensive weight-reduction efforts of the BMW M engineers should not be under looked. The new BMW M3 and BMW M4 are the first BMW M cars to see a reduction in curb weight from one generation to the next. Both models are equipped with an all-new 3.0-liter inline-6 engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and increased performance levels that distinguish them from previous generations of the M3 family, delivering 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Both the M3 Sedan and M4 Coupe accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds when equipped with the optional M-DCT transmission. By setting new segment standards in terms of dynamics, agility, precise handling and emotional design, the new BMW M3 Sedan and BMW M4 Coupe have set the benchmark for the high-performance segment created by the M3 many years ago.

The TL just fell a bit short in both interior and exterior for me. Felt too much like a slightly better Accord for a lot more money.
Ironically I ended up with a Kia So I'm not necessarily into the badge thing, more the value. I didnt feel like the Acura sedans were enough of a value.
This new TLX though is high on my watch list. Right there with the A3/S3."

But, they are getting great performance out of it. As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The new engine is all for CAFE and Emission [non-permissible content removed]'s.. While the V8 was nice, the torque figures were horrible, the new 6 cyl makes almost double of the V8... So the new M cars will really push you into the seat.
Also the weight difference between the M235i and M3/4 cars is significant, being that the M3/4 cars weight less.... I' with you graphic, the new M235i will be the car to get, back to the basic's and for about $44K."

I would buy a diesel-powered BMW with a manual transmission sold in North America.
Why? I am a manual trasmission guy, my current and last three cars have had manual transmission, but diesel engine is probably LEAST fun and LEAST suitable with manual trasmission for a passenger car (it's a little different for towing vehicles and tractor trailers with 10-12 gear manuals used to crawl uphill or just maximize efficiency).
This holiday I drove again (just like last year) my dad's Audi A4 with 1.9 TDI and manual transmission (it has sports suspension, too) and it was not a fun car, not to me anyway. The reason? Simple - diesel powerband is so narrow and short that I had to constantly shift up and down even on straight roads (just slight speed variation made it uncomfortable, if the car was on wrong gear). Ramp merging was a bit less scary than last year (as I got used to it and learned a little), but nevertheless couldn't hold a candle to a nice gasoline engine of similar power (even lower torque), when you can keep your car on same gear up to 5K+ rpm and keep accelerating. Diesel nicely kicks the speed up, but then equally suddenly dies in the middle of the manouver making you shift at least comfortable moment and lose time/distance.
If there is one type of passenger car that I don't mind well spaced and timed multigear automatic (or CVT), it is exactly small diesel. I think people's wish to have MT diesel is simply misguided, based on what is not available and never tried. It almost feels like ""because these evil people don't offer it, it must be good"".

Exactly, the 8 spd in the BMW is one of the best in the business, and it suited for the diesel perfectly. What I have noticed, most of the 328d's on lots in Phoenix, have the sport package as well as M sport package, this give the transmission the Sport + feature. quicker shifting, holds gears longer, quicker throttle, add paddle shifting option and it's one of the best combo's."

I've driven seven different diesels with manual transmissions (not counting my '71 KW with the RT910 Roadranger) in Europe between 2001 and 2013.

Manual transmissions rarely fail and cost significantly less to repair, plus which I can shift when and how I want, including skipping gears or changing my mind in the middle as traffic conditions change. That said, it's clear that BMW knows what it's doing, since there appears to be universal acceptance of what they're peddling.

842,dino001,January 2014,"@m6user:
Well, I guess, our priorities are simply different. I'm sure it probably lies in one's definition of ""fun"" and what each of us considers a good experience. My point of reference for MT experience are good gasoline engines with long powerbands and decent torque (WRX, STI, 328), to which diesel simply cannot hold a candle in terms of driving satisfaction. I talked to many owners of diesels in Europe and ""fun"" is not even in their vocabulary. Their reasons of getting diesel is plain and simple - money.
I consider current 328d a first BMW's legitimate entry in terms of economizing fuel efficiency, Such consideration was not as important in the past, but I guess times change, more and more marginal customers buy those things, so lowering their cost of ownership is one way of expanding the market opportunity. I think the 8AT is just right for it. I don't think 6MT would be any better in terms of driving experience and it would not provide any fuel economy savings. It might provide potential for better durability, but I didn't hear of massive failures of those BMW's autos. I may be misinformed, of course.
The background of European popularity of diesel does not lie in its inherent ""fun"", or otherwise superior performance. It is a plain fuel economy advantage traded for clunky sound, higher noise, lower powerband. The diesel engines went long way from times when they were very slow and had unbearable vibrations. Today's turbos fixed that off-line acceleration problem - in fact the punch provided by diesel is better than gasoline - the only thing is it doesn't last. The maintenance seems to be more of an issue today, that's the price paid for better engine. The engines reportedly do not last as long as they used to, they are more sensitive to fuel quality, which can be a problem in certain areas and repair costs are massive. To be fair, that's true about all cars, not just diesels.
In the world of $8-10/galon fuel (today's prices in Euro zone), every drop counts, so getting your car going further has real financial consequences, even for more affluent people. Only richest of the rich don't have to factor that in, the rest needs to consider if the great gasoline V6/I6, so popular with many Americans (not to mention V8), is affordable. Memo: it is not. Thus, the second and real only choice becomes a decent diesel. Prior recent boom, diesel fuel was also considered a lower grade byproduct and it was taxed less, creating a double bang for a buck (higher mpg on lower priced fuel). That advantage is gone now and one can already see the trend not as strong as it used to be.
2018 430i Gran Coupe"
843,markcincinnati,January 2014,"Regarding Diesels & Transmissions post (above):
I suppose there is some chance that the manual transmission ""option"" will soldier on, probably for several more years. However, the manual transmission is, sadly, on its death-bed. Sadly? Sure, sadly -- because manual transmission cars (or more accurately said ""some"" manual transmission equipped cars) generally speaking are more fun to drive; and, until recently manual transmission cars provided real, measurable benefits simply unavailable with even the best transmissions that shift(ed) themselves.
Today, however, the manual transmission crowd, of which I consider myself to be a member, really doesn't have any attribute (that can be measured) that makes it ""better"" than some automatics. And, the thing is, even those automatics which are inferior -- today -- to a stick-shift, will likely soon be replaced with incrementally better autos until virtually all the automatic transmissions on the market are equal to or better than manuals.
Then, as a natural progression, all automatics offered will render manuals measurably inferior -- leaving only ""fun-to-drive"" as their reasons for being. Of course, in the ELLPS and LPS world, at least, manuals will simply no longer be offered as the upcoming crop of drivers is both unfamiliar with manuals (read: unable to drive them) and really confused as to why anyone would even want to shift a car.
We are progressively moving toward the autonomous automobile -- at least if you believe the story on CBS's Sunday Morning program where the new autonomous technologies were put on display courtesy of Mercedes (and Volvo and, and, and).
Manual transmissions, like light beers, are dead and they just don't know it yet.
I used to jump in a cab in Munich (often a light yellow Mercedes) and most of the time it was a manual transmission diesel version of the MB E Class. These days -- well since 2005 -- most of the cabs are as noted but with automatic transmissions. My assumption is, this can be seen as a bellwether -- either a predictor or cause-agent of things that will ""soon"" be adopted universally.
My 1995 Audi S6 was ONLY available with a manual transmission; I can't even imagine a 2014 S6 so equipped -- and, frankly, despite my ""fun-to-drive"" comments, I can't even imagine I would want a 2014 S6 with a manual trans.
How many of the ELLPS and LPS cars on the market are even offered with an ""optional"" manual transmission? Or perhaps the more pertinent question is what is the % of manual transmission versions of these ELLPS and LPS cars that are sold (at least in the US, anyway)? I would be pleasantly shocked to hear almost any number greater than 2%. The economics of offering an auto and a manual version are, likewise, already in play -- if a German manufacturer has to certify both a manual and an auto version of a model to be able to sell them in the US (and elsewhere, I'd imagine), my guess is they will simply decide there is no economic justification for certifying a model that represents but a tiny portion of sales, no matter what we say here, or no matter what the editors and writers of Car & Driver, et al, [non-permissible content removed] about.
I'm so happy with my S4's 7-Speed S-Tronic (""automatic manual""), I really don't even miss the stick shift. I did, however, test drive the 2014 S4 with a manual, and I must say it sure was ""fun-to-drive"". I'm over it now, however. To the S-Tronic I say: ""You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!”

Now will dealers have many manual transmission cars sitting on their lots, I doubt it.

For BMW the only veichal's that are not part of the ED program are the SUV, i.e X3,5 and 6 since they are made here in the US, however, you can do a factory delivery in Spartenburg, and go through the factory and then spend a day at the performance center. Also with the Ed program for the other cars, you have an option of having the car delivered in Spartenburg, and go through the performance center with your car. So you can take two vacation, one in Europe and One driving your car back home (or have it shipped at your dime home.) On Bimmerfest there is a whole thread about the ED program lots of info and I know that our next BMW will be done this way, I did on my 330i and loved it, but this forum opened my eyes on things I was not aware of before.

If you follow the trend, the SH AWD version will have a 9 speed trans and a 3.5L V6. Guessing that it will put out something in the 310-325 HP range.

My Audi dealer says that based on current inventory, it is now typical for the new cars (without owners names attached already) to be held ""in port"" whilst the current inventory is worked down.
I guess we should appreciate that approach (if we are already owners) since it would seem to help preserve, somewhat, the value of the current model.

I'll lease something like an Accord or Subaru Impreza 5 door and share it with my wife for 15K per year (when she drives the new car, I'll drive her Pilot or my Prelude when the weather is nice).

889,markcincinnati,January 2014,"Regarding the statements: "" BMW probably does the most to subsidize their leases. I think Mercedes does, too."" And: ""I wouldn't call it subsidizes they have programs...""
Well, the truth of the matter is that BMW [among others] does provide ""financial support"" for leases made through their financial companies. This support is often (usually) called a ""sub-vented lease.""
Subventing makes leasing more attractive to the buyer who doesn't care so much about the MSRP of a given vehicle, but does care about the monthly payment. Either a purchase or a lease ""deal"" can be subvented -- but the real impact of subventing is going to be able to be much greater for a lease than a loan.
The best thing that can be done regarding a loan to buy a new car is that the interest rate charged can be set to zero (0% apr). This way a $36,000 car can be purchased and the payments determined by dividing $36,000 by the number of months that payments will be made. $36,000 divided by 36 months, then, equals DOH! a $1,000 per month payment.
I assume we could stretch the point and say that the manufacturer could offer a ""loyalty"" or ""conquest"" or even a ""just because"" bonus or rebate or discount of $1,000, making the amount financed be only $35,000, meaning the payment would be $35,000 divided by 36 months or $972.22/month.
A subvented lease, on the other hand, is where the mfg can really influence your ""purchase"" decision. Here's why.
When you lease a new car, the payment will be determined (generally speaking) by several things:
1.The % of value (residual value) that the car will have at the end of the lease
2.The money factor (think of it as the interest rate) that is used.
Roughly speaking you can calculate the lease payment (remember the word ""roughly"") by subtracting the residual value from the MSRP of the car to get your anticipated usage cost.
If the car is $36,000 and its residual is 50%, your usage over 36 months is $18,000. If you put money (out of your pocket) as what you might term a ""down payment"" you will reduce the amount of the ""agreement"" by that amount (this is called a capitalized cost reduction).
This ""down payment"" [in your mind] does not reduce the residual value of the car, meaning that if you decided to buy the car at the end of the lease the amount you will have to come up with will still be $18,000. Please, don't call any money down on a conventional (closed-end) lease a down payment and I won't either. It is a ""cap cost reduction"" -- and the purpose of this cap cost reduction is solely to reduce the monthly payment. You are NOT building up any value, post lease, whatsoever.
The money factor (or the implied cost of money -- or interest rate) is applied to recognize the value of the ""time"" you have the auto mfg's finance arm's money tied up.
Far more detailed explanations -- and explanations that are specific to your lease deal -- are available here on Edmunds and of course at your dealership.
The bottom line, however, is this: the auto manufacturer's financial outlet may offer a lease to you that has been subvented by the manufacturer. The subventing can take the form of:
A reduction of the money factor -- including taking it to zero; or,
An increase of the residual % -- including taking it to a very optimistic % (+5% or even more) -- meaning the car will be said to be worth a much larger percentage of its brand new value than market conditions would likely support.
This manipulation of the residual cannot be done when the car is financed outright -- so perhaps you can see that a subvented lease could produce a very very low monthly payment if the mfg decides to reduce the money factor to zero or near zero and increases the residual value significantly over the expected depreciation.
Subvented leases often carry with them terms that are not as ""friendly"" to you as a straight buy with a loan or a lease that has not been subvented.
If the manufacturer says the residual is 62% after 36 months and the reality of the situation is that the 36 month value should only be 55%, you may not be able to get out of your lease early without a huge $ penalty (plus perhaps a standalone early termination fee or penalty).
If you buy and finance a car, you can sell or trade you car almost at any time and only pay the potential difference between the outstanding loan amount and the amount you can sell the car for. It may feel like a prepayment penalty, but the reality is that there will be no literal prepayment penalty (it is uncommon for an auto loan from a bank, for instance, to have a prepayment penalty -- if you want to get out of the loan, you can sell the car and give the proceeds to the bank plus a bit more out of your pocket or perhaps a check from the bank.)
So, leases give, leases take. Leases are sometimes of the very, very low payment variety -- meaning there is some subventing going on and suggesting that you'd better be prepared to not fall out of love with your new baby for ""about 90%"" of the lease's term. I say that because it is also common practice to put customers in 39 month leases and then around month 33 start to seduce ""owners"" into the showrooms with the promise of letting them out of their leases without penalties if they re-lease the new model.
BMW does have a reputation -- I assume well founded -- for ""supporting"" (subventing) leases. This can make getting into a $50,000 Bimmer ""within reach."" It also pretty much locks customers into the cycle of ""lease, burn through the lease, and re-lease"" again and again.
Nothing wrong with that for a lot of consumers. But not for all.
If you want to keep your car 5 years or longer, you may not find leasing economics works for you;
If you drive more than 18,000 miles per year (and probably the message could be ""more than 15,000 miles per year), you may not find leasing economics works for you (as your residual will likely drop sharply, meaning the monthly payment will rise sharply in response);
If you own a business, on the other hand, leasing may mean you can ""expense your lease payment"" to the company (with proper and available proof), which many would consider to be a good thing;
If you want to build equity in your car, well that is ""highly"" (or at least ""fairly"") unlikely in a leased car, but more likely in a car that you are making payments on to buy.
And the pros of leasing AND buying go on.
Neither my wife nor I had ever purchased a car, until late 2013 when we bought her '14 Audi SQ5 Prestige; we also lease a '14 Audi S4 (and are fully intending, 4 months into the lease, to buy the thing at the end of the lease -- and we put NO money down on the lease). This is a new experience for us and we keep rationalizing that -- at this time -- buying (for us) will likely turn out to be a better deal since we intend on keeping the cars more than 5 years.
So, my point in all that is above is this: Auto manufacturers DO indeed provide financial subsidies (i.e., named subvented lease programs). Multiple security deposits are NOT, strictly speaking, subsidies, however.

If you can or want to put money down on the lease and it gets you where you want to be, I have no issue with it. However, if you've got that money, I would assume you also can justify lighting your cigars with paper money instead of matches (wooden, of course).
Seriously, money to lower a lease payment is somewhat hard to justify these days. If $2,995 lowers the mo pay by $100 for 36 months, wouldn't it be acceptable to put the money in an account and know that at least you've got 30 of the next 36 payments (the $100 difference, that is) accounted for?
Let's not assume we know how better to spend someone else's money.
I've learned a lot from Edmunds and Audi World, etc; I used to think putting something toward the lease was at least OK.

@markincincinnati brought up a great point about GAP insurance. It's automatically written into every auto leasing and financing contract in New York State. So there's another ""if"" that could have potentially cost me more money by leasing from a dealer here in Connecticut. Depending on the dealer, they charge $400 - $700 for this optional protection. So between the high doc fee, the GAP insurance, the possibility of being offered significantly less on the trade, and even a little more on the price of the car, maybe it would be a wash.

The price shoppers will plunk down 3K to get that 50K car for 410/m but the people who really understand how it all works wouldn't do that. Lately BMW has been offering some ""incentive cash."" $750 for having BMSCCA account, $500 for being a USAA member, and currently BMW has $750 back on all 3 series. So right there you are talking $2250, this will cover fee's and first month payment, and a slight cap reduction (remember all this is ZERO out of pocket.) then add 7 MSDs, so basically you could just walk into the dealer, with $3500 and walk out with a payment of $540/m on that 50K car, and at the end of your lease get that $3500 back. Those 7 MSD's well save you roughly $50/m x 36 = $1800. So you could walk into and have a cap reduction that doesn't cost you a cent but helps to lower the payments slightly. When I did my deal on my 320, I was very temped to lease since BMW was giving me 2K built credit and 1K for my grad degree, a total of 3K, plus add $2400 for 7 MSDs, my payments would have been $280/m."

However, we won’t have to wait too long to see the car revealed, according to the latest reports.
Just-Auto, based on an interview with Jaguar design boss Ian Callum, is reporting that the new car, rumored to be called the XS, will be revealed as early as this summer. This suggests that we could see it, or at least a concept version, unveiled at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in late June, the Brit event where last year Jaguar presented its Project 7 concept car.
During the same interview, Callum is also reported to have said that Jaguar is planning facelifts for several models, including the recently launched F-Type range. Though he didn’t confirm plans for any other models, we know due to test mule sightings that Jaguar is also working on a new crossover as well as a next-generation XF.
As for the XS, it is based on the aforementioned iQ[Al] structure, a lightweight aluminum design that will incorporate a new family of four-cylinder engines called the Hotfire series.

After having an Infiniti g for 39400 miles I recently (2 days ago) swapped for a 13 slightly used and nicely discounted audi s4. Will report back on how its behaving- very impressed by both acceleration, and technology in the new rig. Also its very quiet in comfort mode vs the Japanese version. I will say this about my old G - no problems - a great car for the money and very nice highway cruiser. The audi while very nice has a lot to live up to given its inflated price- will report back as the miles pile up.

The best part of the MSD is the fact you get your deposits back at the end of the lease, so you saved money on money returned.. It is really a no brainier for people who lease.. BTW, the ED is really the only way to go, we are planing on a ED in 2015 with a Performance Center pick up."

Now sweendogy will know what we mean by the Infiniti G being ""growly"" as compared to other engines, and also why we love driving German cars. Hopefully he also won't see any of the legendary German reliability issues as compared to most Asian makes!"
911,sweendogy,February 2014,"@tlong- the growl while louder then a German sedan that costs a minimum of 10k more was one I actually loved while pushing up an on ramp- and knew every time I heard that growl I was going to pass most cars as I entered. I hope I don't see the German dragons because like I mentioned earlier the g had no issues.
4 days old to me- its a tight sedan- sure the s4 trim is nice - the technology and dash layout very tight- the buttons near the shifter and toggle buttons all over the steering wheel and stalks are way over the top and take away from driving. I wanted one with the rear sports diff and waited to get this one- haven't noticed it yet- but others have posted its a must. Time will tell- car in the snow with winter tires is a real cat, can't wait for the summer as I will slap 19' slicks on."

914,markcincinnati,February 2014,"My second new S4 came in late last month -- and I'm loving it! OK, OK, not literally another actual car, rather the Audi break-in part one (~5,000 miles) and a check up and oil change at the dealer.
This 2014 Audi S4 is like every other Audi I've had since 1977 -- you end up getting a new car (on the day you pick it up) and then you get another ""new car"" at 5,000 and around 10,000 miles as the engine seems to really get stronger and stronger.
We've had the worst winter here in SW Ohio in what seems like decades (some local weather types have said this has been one of our worst in over 20 years) and I felt no need to swap tires. The all-seasons that the car came with had zero problems.
My wife's SQ5 (purchased about 6 weeks or so after my S4) has 20"" Continental Extreme DWS all seasons (UHP too) and she's has no traction issues either. I watch the man screaming QUATTRO!!!! on the commercial told from the POV of a tow-truck driver and we are living proof of the prowess of the quattro AWD system.
Sweendogy, I suspect there isn't too much different between your 2013 S4 and my '14, other than the fact that you were able to pay less -- I hope your car is under warranty and is CPO'd, which should at least provide you with the peace of mind (financially) you want. I'll bet any repairs on an S4 out of warranty will be breathtakingly expensive (shudder.)
I finally saw my first SQ5 (other than my wife's) a couple of days ago -- and, finally, finally, saw my first Q50 at long last. Boy, the sales on that one must be slow; I've seen several Lexus IS's though, making me think that one has been a heckuva lot more successful in the market.
The new TLX (show car) actually seems pretty attractive -- although I don't really miss my '12 TL, I don't have any real complaints about it now that it's gone -- the S4 is a totally different experience, but, to my dying day, I do think Acura's TL SH-AWD was their version of an S4 (for a lot less $).
I sat in an S6 at the dealer recently -- now that may be my new Batmobile -- but, hey, for $80,000+ it ought to be.
Anyone have the sales figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 for our list of ELLPS cars?
I'd love to see how the IS, Q50, TL, A4/S4, etc did and are selling.

915,sweendogy,February 2014,"Mark - from my understanding the 14 s4 came with standard smart key access and maybe on other item items - on reliability I know audi has gotten way better, but as of right now I have plenty of warrantee ahead."
916,markcincinnati,February 2014,"The ONLY Audi I had that really, truly SCARED me, with respect to reliability, durability and co$t to keep post-warranty, was my 1997 A8. The thing, in warranty thankfully, kept having failure after failure of ""little and medium"" components. I didn't have engine or transmission problems, but I suspect things like the motors (and it had a bunch of them) that controlled the seats, seat belt height and on and on, just kept failing (and being replaced again and again.)
My subsequent Audi was a 2000 A6 4.2, which had brake rotor issues -- but nothing else other than routine mntce to speak of; same thing with my 2001 A6 4.2, brake rotors and everything else was solid.
Since then, my 2003 allroad, 2005 A6 3.2, 2009 A4 2.0T and my current 2014 S4 all seemed to me (pretty early on the S4 though) to be reliable. My 2005 A6, which I kept to about 66,000 miles as I recall, also would make me say ""durable."" Yet, these days with several of the Japanese maker's cars easily going 150,000 miles with ""routine"" mntce, 66K miles hardly is proof positive.
One of the people I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series and he did buy the extended SERVICE package when he purchased the car new. This was NOT a warranty -- just an extended ""factory"" mntce policy. After 50K miles, these German cars often require wholesale replacement of ""stuff"" in the name of service (maintenance, i.e.)
Audi, too, offers extended mntce (for a price) and there is some procedure you can go through to get your own car CPO'd (again, for a price) which takes the warranty to 100,000 miles (up to 6 years from first date of use). After 100K miles, however, you're on your own.
Here is the thing my friend has found with his BMW -- with his extended service contract in hand, he was able to have a fully paid off car with no added service charges for about 2 years. Then, after the service contract died, he did have some on-going (fairly expensive) service or repairs (it is hard to know, sometimes what is ""broken"" and what is just ""time to replace""), but the cost of the repairs at MAX was $1,400 and typically was $100-$300 -- and didn't actually happen frequently. So, the cost of having a very well maintained, comfortable, good performing 2005 5 series was, at most, $2,000 in one year, typically half that.
When I get in his 2005 BMW, I can tell it isn't as up to date (with respect to the electronics for instance) as a 2014 Audi S4, but overall it is still clearly a very nice performance/luxury car that when detailed looks in near showroom condition and is cheap to own.
I'm looking forward to the latter -- even though I do love to keep up with all the new-tech.
I'm driving my wife's 2014 SQ5 Prestige today -- wow, in some respects I like it better than my S4! Of course the S4 has the S-tronic transmission which has to be driven to be believed.

I'd be afraid of any of those top-of the line Eurocars out of warranty too. The complex systems always turn up on the A8s, 7ers and S-Classes before they migrate to lesser models. Apparently by the time they go downscale they're pretty much de-bugged. I'm on my third out-of-warranty German car including a 5 Series that now has 150K on it and has only had one expensive failure (Vanos Control Module- $1200). I could be wrong about all this but I've been driving nice cars for the cost of run-of-the mill ones for a decade and a half..

At least I should be good for at least another five years/57K on both the new plugs and battery. Driving away the DCT fault light came on. Turns out the steering angle sensor didn't initialize after the battery swap. Ten minutes later my tech beat it into submission and we had no issues after that.
If you haven't guessed, this incident-along with BMW's rush to convert most every vehicle in their lineup into a soulless Germanic Lexus-is what has caused me to seriously consider finding another 1988 M6 to share the garage with the Club Sport.

There's also a lot of moaning among the hard core Propellerheads that BMW shouldn't be making a ""minivan"" but with a 105"" wheelbase the Active Tourer is considerably shorter than the smallest Minivan on the US market, the Mazda 5 (@108"").

Yes and I'm quite excited about it. It will have a rear hatch, just like GT, but it will be lower to the ground, i.e. much more sporty in driving experience. Unlike 3-series wagon, it will be available as 335 and my understanding is RWD, not just AWD, as both GT and wagon.

There is no way in hell I would have ever been able to find and remove the spare tire from under the car if it weren't for the owner's manual (which was thankfully in the car). Even after removing the center console and lowering the spare to the ground using the special tool, I still didn't know how to get the damned cable off the spare, and even the owner's manual left that part out. Eventually got the job done, but not without alot of frustration.

It already is here, last six months. I think, once GC is here and you look at them side by side, you'll see difference that is large enough to understand there is a real choice. GT is a peoplemover, large legroom, softer suspension, standard AWD, etc. - it was made for all those who want sporty BRAND, but [non-permissible content removed] about the rear seat, or ""horrible hard suspension"" in a sporty CAR. GC is more driver's car with SOME room for other people and improved cargo space, available as RWD. It is for people who know exactly what a ""sporty coupe"" really means (I said ""sporty"", not ""sports""), but just want incremental (read limited) improvement in people and cargo moving abilities vs. traditional coupe.
Think 5-series GT vs 6-series GC. Those are quite a bit different vehicles for different customers.

My Dad had an '07 X5 which was the 1st car BMW introduced with the ""beer tap shifter."" One morning in a snow storm, he drove over a 2 x 4 (that he couldn't see). The ""low coolant"" light went on, so he pulled over, shut the truck off, and looked to see if there was any coolant spewing out from underneath it. He lifted the hood and everything looked OK. He fired the X5 back up and was about to head to the dealer, when he looked down at the dash and the low coolant light wasn't on anymore. So he continued on his way to work.
Now I have to tell you that my Dad travels back and forth to work with his 2 Great Danes. He keeps a piece of plywood over the folded rear seats to keep his truck cleaner.
Anyway, its snowing, it's 6:30 AM, and my Dad's X5 literally shuts off in the middle of the Tappan Zee Bridge. I'm cleaning off my Prelude getting ready to go to work and I see he keeps calling me. Maybe he plans to tell me about an accident on the way (we work together)? I listen to the voice mail, he says: ""call me, I'm stuck on the bridge.""
I call him back and he tells me the story, then asks: ""how do I get this thing into neutral so the thruway authority can load it on the flatbed?"" He checks the owner's manual. Without the owner's manual we sold have never figured out:
Remove the cup holder, remove the piece under the cup holder, remove red ""T"" key from the spare tire compartment. Stick the red ""T"" key into the square hole underneath the cup holders and twist to release the transmission so vehicle can be loaded on to flatbed.
Just a few problems, he had to get out of the car in the snow on a bridge (cars flying by on the driver's side & the Hudson River on the passenger side). Open the rear lift gate to get to the ""T"" key where the spare tire is seems easy enough, except it was under a piece of plywood perfectly cut to fit the rear of the X5. The tow truck drivers from the NYS Thruway Authority can't help him because every time they try to help my Dad pick up the plywood, his 140 lb Great Danes start barking and scare the pants off the poor guys.

You'll get no argumet about that from me. Counterintuitive is being kind regarding their shifter. Eventually, many years later, they usually get it right (i.e. iDrive). But, it takes years of customers telling them they got it wrong to begin with for them to correct their mistakes.

At least the Jaguar shifter is relatively easy to figure out, although I'd dread the day when the car fires up but the knob refuses to elevate.
I remember the year BMW introduced the beer tap; at the BMW CCA Oktoberfest BMW NA had several test drive cars and the BMW reps running the show had to spend a minute or two with each member before their drive explaining how the shifter worked. That is just ridiculous. Aside from the space saving justification given earlier no one has been able to explain how the beer tap is superior to a conventional automatic shift lever.
I would not be surprised if BMW's designers get bored and decide to steal a page from Ford's Edsel playbook- and put all the shift controls on the steering wheel hub...

Any car, even a ""bulletproof"" one, will start to cost money every year after 10 yrs old and over 100k miles. If it's less than a couple of car payments you're still doing pretty well. If in fact you need an engine rebuild, you got extremely unlucky if it was being taken care of.

993,Mr_Shiftright,February 2014,"Basically you pump compressed air into each cylinder (top dead cener) with a special gauge and measure the % of leakdown (air leaking past worn parts). A variation of 10% between cylinders is probably not acceptable. THEN you actually listen for where the air is leaking...if you see bubbles in your coolant, you have a head gasket leak--if you hear air rusing out of your intake, you have intake valve or valve seal or guide problems; if you hear out of the exhaust pipe, you have an exhaust valve problem, and if you hear air coming out of your oil filler cap or dipstick hole, you have ring and piston problems.

While it's certain;y true that it costs more to maintain an older car it's not a given that they become money pits after 100K/10years. A well maintained modern car should have a ""service life"" of at least 150k and 15 years before it becomes cheaper to scrap it and buy new.

A friend of mine, a marketing executive for a national software firm, always buys BMW’s and claims Audis are exclusively for “left-brainers” (I started out life as a computer programmer, so maybe there is something to that) because they appeal to technical types (tech-weenies, to quote my friend); you know these folks, those people who not only can create elaborate spreadsheets with impossible formulas, but also who can write actual computer programs as well. My wise-guy friend claims, even though Audi engines, transmissions and sumptuous interiors are either proclaimed by the motoring press to be “the best” or at least “tied for the top,” Audis remain soul-less machines, sorely lacking the all-important emotional hook to keep “serious” car people interested and perhaps entertained. They (Audis) are extremely competent and confidence inspiring pieces of machinery, but they somehow are not the stuff that inspires passionate prose – even though they are often the winners of three, four and five-way motoring press “comparo” reports.
Although I, apparently, am in the minority who do not doubt Audi’s soul can be seen, heard and felt in its cars, I now present an S4 update now that I have passed 5,000 miles – much of it being driven in sub-freezing weather and on snow and ice-covered roads.
The Audi in question is an Ibis white 2014 S4 Premium Plus model with the 7-speed S-Tronic transmission, 18” wheels shod with all-season tires, MMI/Navigation+, B&O audio, Magma Red Napa leather seats, carbon fiber trim, Audi side assist and Audi Care. I guess, perhaps I even wish, I would have gone for the Prestige model, now that I think of it, just for the articulating headlights. Of course now that I know how inexpensive the sport differential is, I should have insisted on getting that, too. With shipping and Audi Care, the pre-tax price was $57+K. As a member of the Audi Club of North America, I got an “automatic” 6% off the sticker, and as an Ohio resident, had to pay 6.5% sales tax. I put no money down and leased the car. I plan to buy the car and the Audi extended service package, if it proves itself to be as durable as it is fun to drive. I believe there is a way, too, to CPO my own car (for a price) giving me a warranty to 100,000 miles.
At 5,000 miles the first service – basically an inspection and an oil and filter change – is required, subsequent service intervals are 10,000 miles.
First off, the car has had no issues of any kind beyond a flat tire which only required a patch to remedy. Even on the coldest mornings (minus 11 F), starting was no problem and since I have heated seats there was only short-lived temperature discomfort. My butt was quickly warmed up, that is.
Second, the S4 with the S-Tronic transmission is beyond a pleasure to drive – it goes all the way to fun to drive coupled with a boatload of confidence inspiration. The engine, transmission, brake and steering combination work together so well they have convinced me they are telepathic, responding to my foot and hand commands in real time. There is no latency: Press the accelerator and the car doesn’t pause that millisecond every other car I have ever had did, indeed it seems to accelerate almost a millisecond before my brain receives the confirmation from my foot that the pedal has been pressed. The paddle shifters, too, act, they don’t react – when I ask for an upshift, the speed at which the next highest gear is selected is faster (and smoother) even than the best manual transmission upshift, I could ever pull off. And, I should also tell you that the brakes slow or stop the car with such speed and control it is as if I had hit a giant, super-thick foam rubber wall. Finally, the S4 goes where you point it, when you point it. Body roll is minimal and it corners like a Ken Onion chef’s knife carves a tender beef roast.
Other than the unabashed fart-like exhaust sound that accompanies high RPM upshifts, the S4 is very quiet and civilized inside, and the tuneage delivered through the B&O speaker system is sick – although I do miss the extra kick from the sub-woofer in the Acura TL’s DVD-Audio system.
This year, Drive Select is standard, and it allows, in Individual mode, the driver to change the characteristics of the engine/transmission, steering and exhaust system sound. Settings generally include Comfort, Auto and Dynamic. I have mine set for Dynamic (engine/transmission), Auto (steering) and Comfort (exhaust note sound), although under full-throttle, even in Comfort mode, the engine growls and the exhaust snorts right on cue whenever the transmission upshifts.
I have no intention of taking this (or my wife’s SQ5) to the track, but wrist-watch timed runs from 0 to 60 are, always under 5-seconds. To me, the S4 is a rocket in terms of its quickness; I’ll not be chipping this engine – it doesn’t need it. Time and distance take on entirely new meanings with an S4 – something I do attribute partially to the wonderful (Red) sport seats. Nobody does sport-seats better than Audi.
In sum, at 5,000 miles the already quick S4 engine seems to have found and made available about 5% more horsepower and torque from just above idle on to redline. I will look forward to repeating this “+5%” phenomenon again, if all goes as usual, again at 10,000 miles.
Perhaps because S4’s are not typically plentiful at your local dealer – there are rarely more than one or two of them at any of the Audi dealers I’ve been to over nearly three decades, they are “outta sight and outta mind” for many premium sport-sedan shoppers. This is a pity, for the S4 is that rare automobile that artfully combines, sport, luxury and a fair amount of practicality (it is in one of American’s most sought after configuration – a four-door sedan) in one fun package. If your auto shopping list currently includes an Acura TLX [coming soon], BMW 335, Infiniti Q50S, Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, Mercedes C-class or Volvo S60 Type-R, you owe it to yourself to take a long test drive in an Audi S4. If money is an object, I would assume a great second choice would be the upcoming TLX, assuming Acura keeps the S4-lite theme of the current TL SH-AWD alive and well. Or, you could get an A4 S-Line and have many of the same goodies that make the S4 such a treat.
I’m getting the heck outta here now, while it’s still light out, and I’m going to take the long way home.

I never said anything about an older car with over 100k miles automatically becoming a money pit. What I said was that a well maintained car that age/miles will probably need a couple of repairs equating to a couple of car payments......maybe something like $1000-$1200 per year. That is very reasonable because one, there are no car payments. Two, insurance is cheap as it doesn't pay to carry collision on a car over 10 years old IMO. Three, you don't worry about it in parking lots so much anymore or sliding off the road on ice or snow quite as much. A little less stressful. Probably the most stressful thing is the worry of when the next thing is going to break and is it going to strand you or not. Doesn't bother me so much but I would worry about my wife or daughter having a situation."

You hit the nail on the head. You budget for repairs & maintenance. Most people don't do that. They pay a car off and don't think about what it is going to cost to keep it on the road for X more years. They just blow their former car payment and then either put the next major repair on a credit card or trade the car in and take out a loan on a new car.
A lot of people don't look at big picture things like total cost of ownership, instead choosing to focus on the monthly payment amount.

1001,stickguy,February 2014,"now that I have inherited my Acura TL back (a 2000 with 174K on the clock) I do enjoy not really caring where I park. With the good cars, I OCD in a parking lot and go way away from other cars when possible. The TL has a few parking lot dings and a lot of scratches (patina?) already, so I don't think I would notice a few more.
as to repairs, in the last couple of years it has needed some unexpected ones. But, no collision on it (makes a difference when my 18 YO is the driver assigned to it). Hopefully though nothing big happens, since I want to get some more ""cheap"" use out of it before selling it at the end of the summer.

Heresy if repeated over on Chronic Car Buyers!
Debating what to do about the Lexus, get a second opinion. At a cost, of course. But, will live with it for a while, keep a couple of quarts of high-mileage oil in the trunk, check the dipstick (so nice to have a dipstick!) religiously. Wife would be up for a remanufactured engine, if that's the route we go. She had a coworker who went that route with his Toyota truck, he claimed he got another 100k miles out of the truck post re-engined.
Probably limited or no road trips in the Lexus, just local driving, keep it for the utility. If we do re-engine it, at least it is a used car I'm familiar with and know it to be well maintained! Back in my XF, which still looks and smells new. Well, looks new under the winter coat all over the car...

I've only had my car for 2 weeks- will say with snow tires its a bull. Hills and turns not an issue even in 6 inches of loose snow. The car with snows is noisier then the old G was - but it does get 4-5 mpg better in my limited time in mixed driving. I drive mostly in individual mode- I set the exhaust to be dynamic (infinit standard), steering dynamic and engine in auto. I've also set the speed limit alert to 80mph as its very easy to miss given the small readout- I've also found the digital speedo to be extremely helpful- I have the V1 hard mounted near the passenger visor as well.

1016,markcincinnati,February 2014,"@sweendogy: I read an article about the ""individual"" settings that suggested the steering will perform at its best if set to Auto. I can't seem to locate the article, but I know it was in a fairly recent Car & Driver or Automobile or Road & Track, since those are the publications I subscribe to.
I don't know if I can honestly tell much of a difference, but for what it's worth, I set mine to Dynamic, Auto & Comfort (engine/transmission, steering, exhaust sound, respectively).
The primary (perhaps the ONLY) difference with the engine/transmission setting at dynamic is that the transmission will default to S mode which seems to hold in gear longer before upshift, perform obvious rev matches during downshifts and make the ""fart"" sound on upshifts more aggressive (hence my setting of ""comfort"" for the engine sound).
Now that I have passed 5,000 miles I am noticing better gas mileage, improved performance and a feeling of ""less friction"" overall. I had really missed the cruise control in the Audi -- when I set the CC to, say, 45MPH in the Acura TL SH-AWD and then find myself going down a rather steep hill seeing a curve at the bottom, the Acura would start freewheeling, so to speak and pick up more and more speed (based on the grade). Then, to negotiate the turn, I would have to brake -- which turned the cruise control off, of course. In the Audi, set the CC for 45MPH and go down a virtual vertical drop and the CC holds the speed at 45MPH, period. Then when reaching the base of the downhill, I can negotiate the curve without killing the cruise control.
It is a little thing, perhaps for some people. But my 2005 A6 and 2009 A4 had this feature and my 2011 Infiniti and 2012 Acura did not -- it seemed [on those Japanese premium cars] like a huge oversight.
Another thing I like about the Audi CC is if you've set it, say, at 75MPH and you come into a heavily monitored construction zone where the speed limit is reduced to 55MPH, you can toggle the CC stalk to 55 and the car brakes and resets itself at 55. With the Acura, for instance, you could only coast down or apply the brakes yourself.
I know there will be folks who are dead set against the car having this much ""intelligence"" or autonomy (and this ain't THAT much, folks), but it can simply be turned off if you don't want to ""enjoy"" a tiny bit smarter cruise control.
In any case, I keep forgetting just how much technology comes with these German cars -- and how it does its best to help you not get ticketed and remain in control. I give this feature alone an ""A"" for its contribution to safety.

My wife's Mazda CX-7 does that as well ... will automatically downshift the automatic transmission to a lower gear to maintain the set speed on CC when going down hills. I agree, it's a nice feature to have - especially here in Colorado, where we have a fair amount of elevation change on the roads.

My BMW does this as well, infact when the car applys the brakes the brakes lights come on. I have been traveling between Phoenix and San Diego quite a bite as my father was in the hospital, and found this feature very helpful. I wonder why Acura do not do this.."
1019,markcincinnati,February 2014,"The Audi's backup camera screen shows trajectory lines that ""curve"" as the steering wheel is turned. The Acura? Straight lines, no curve, no match to steering wheel inputs.
Now, the Infiniti, it had front camera and rear camera and trajectory lines when the car was in reverse and drive -- of course, it also had the wonderful, fantastic, gotta have it, around-view monitor. Of course now both Audi and BMW offer this tech, but it is still not universal.
Of course, I recently read an article about how many times backup camera adoption has been pushed to a future year -- I guess we should feel good that the German and Japanese (premium) cars typically come standard with such tech and that it is pretty much ""available"" on the lesser cars from that mfgr.
Looks like backup cameras are ""probably"" going to be required as of January 2015 -- but don't hold your breath. By the time the backup camera is a requirement, the all-around or top-view systems will be the norm in the premium segment.
If you've not seen what an all-around top-view, etc, set-up can do, check out your nearest Infiniti showroom -- this is seriously cool tech that makes driving and parking in tight spaces, oh, only about a MILLION PERCENT easier and safer!
I graduated from college in 1973 (yep, I am old) and I took a course in 1971 where a new technology was introduced (in a Chrysler, no less): anti-lock brakes. 1971. Let that sink in -- the first car I was personally aware of that could actually have ABS as it came to be called was a 1985 model year BMW ""7"" series which, as I recall, came to the US market in calendar 1984.
What in the wide-wide world of sports took 13 years [for anti-lock brakes] to go from Chrysler (std equipment on the gas-turbine car they produced) to BMW (probably sourced from Bosch). The year following, ABS was offered on the Audi 200 (US name 5000S) quattro (and probably the FWD version too for that matter.) Yet, when was it that mere mortals could get ABS on their Blue Ovals and Bow Ties? It seems like it took decades!
Of course it took another automotive eternity to make ESP widely available, too. To a certain extent Audi took a helluva long time to bring ""torque vectoring"" (aka ""sport differential"") to market -- doing so, I believe, sometime after Acura announced their version of torque vectoring with the mouthful of a name -- SH-AWD.
I've had ABS, ESP, TPMS, sat nav, voice activation, blind spot monitoring, bi-xenon head-lights (except for the Acura), back-up or all-around view cameras and monitors and a whole host of other ""ought to be standard equipment"" stuff for longer than I can remember (and it is not -- yet -- due to a fading memory); this stuff is very cheap to make and probably all of this technology can fit in the space of one chip, with room to spare, these days. Why does the trickle down or even just the offering of the technology move at glacial speed for pity's sake?
Another technology that ""ought to be standard"" is the 7, 8 or 9 (or more) speed transmission. I believe a base 4-cylinder 2010 Audi A4 was offered with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission; and, I believe every or virtually every BMW can be had with an 8 speed unit, too. The 8-speed's reason for being is economy and performance, yes? Why didn't Chevy -- to name one -- do what these Germans did: go to ZF and buy the 8-speed units and tout their benefits in their brand new Impalas and SS's and, same question for Ford. The efficiency and performance gains alone should have made this worth doing -- instead we've got a whole bunch of new ""made in the USA"" cars with ""old"" 6-speed transmissions.

Mark, ABS was standard on MB S class in 1985, my 86 300SDL had them standard. Now did you know the Oldsmobile was the first US manufacture to have an Airbag as an option in the 70's. Needless to say, not many where sold...
I thought Lexus was the first manufacture to come out with the 8 spd in the LS430. I do agree with you Mark that US automakers really needed to see the benefit of the 8 or 9 spd auto. I know that my BMW wouldn't be as lively if it had the old 6 spd steptronic."
1022,Mr_Shiftright,February 2014,"That's right--1971 Chrysler Imperial had ABS on all 4 wheels. And apparently, it worked quite well."
1023,markcincinnati,February 2014,"Glad to see ""us"" scratching our heads wondering why the nearly 13 year gap between working ABS in a Chrysler (I think it was only 2-channel ABS, but hey it worked) and the German's putting it in their top of the line models. I had a 1986 Audi 5000CS quattro and it had ABS -- indeed, it had an ""off on"" ABS switch on the dash. The owner's manual explained when ABS worked and when it was best to turn it off.
Of course they took the switch away when they found out that sometimes people would turn ABS off at inappropriate times because they thought there was something wrong with their brakes since they ""pulsed"" when ABS was activated.
A case of ignorance winning out over technology.
According to the owner's manual, you should turn your ABS off when driving in deep gravel or deep not packed (fluffy) snow, since you could use a locked wheel/tire to slow you down in deep gravel since a mound of gravel would pile up under the tires rapidly shedding speed. The mound-ing effect was cancelled by the action of the ABS, making the stopping more difficult in deep snow or gravel.
In any case, my confusion and perhaps even frustration is with the slow adoption of tech that is actually very inexpensive. And American mfgrs are some of the worst offenders. Hell, they'll jump on putting power windows in an el cheapo car, but delay for decades incorporating ABS, ESP, blind spot monitoring, etc etc etc. I would assume the cost of the hardware for power windows, power sunroofs and power door locks is more than the cost of a backup camera and blind spot monitoring, for example.
I'm pretty confident that the reason for the delay has something to do with perceived demand, costs and what the mfgr must see as their customers' perception of the value of such tech.
To me, this [safety and/or performance and/or convenience] tech is almost essential any more. Even though I think factory sat nav is outrageously priced, I wouldn't leave home without it -- but c'mon to add ""MMI"" to an Audi is $3,500 -- and for that you get sat nav, bluetooth and voice activation of several of the car's systems -- all nicely integrated. This has to provide Audi with a super high gross margin -- and, even knowing that, the majority of cars my Audi dealer sells (which are overwhelmingly Q5s and A4s) come with MMI, ""because that's what people want.""
Maybe things like ABS, when they were a $500 option, just didn't seem sexy enough, no matter how little it cost. Of course, now we're moving into a whole new era of auto tech -- autonomy. . . .

1024,dino001,February 2014,"I think the issue was perception of safety as a priority. At that time it was not not perceived as such and stereo or power windows sold well, whereas ABS or airbags were considered ""fluff"". There were many examples of drivers choosing entertainment, or convenience options over safety when it was done as an alternative of ""free upgrade"", or simple limit of total price. It changed today, but it is still expected to be ""free"". In other words ABS or stability control should be ""free"" (i.e. included in price that is same as last year model), but leather or premium stereo, no problem as an option.
To best see how peoples' preferences changed is to watch evolution of Toyota cars. Toyota has almost six sense, when it comes to timing standard inclusion of equipment in the model vs. market demands. When Toyota offers something standard, it means the segment requires that as such. When it is still an expensive option, it means people will either be willing to pay extra or so without it. Detroit (GM especially) had an opposite problem - wrong timing. They'd put something on when nobody saw that necessary (e.g. ABS on Cavalier), but later they'd remove it when market was just about to demand it.

To be fair though the American companies have introduced a lot of technology in the lower end of the market first ( Chrysler with at least a driver side air bag in pretty much every car they sold way before anybody else put them in standard) and GM with ABS in the Cavalier as already mentioned, and I think they were one of the first with traction control as standard in some lower end cars as well ( grand ams for instance). At least there is no longer an Americans car to hat I know off that still comes with a four speed transmission ( unlike Toyota). The eight, nine, and ten speed transmissions are coming from the us manufactures, but it takes time to not only develop them, but to get suppliers to make the parts, and factories tooled to get them built, and to figure out how to make it cost effective to put them in lower end models, they aren't free after all. And why just pick on the American manufactures, where are the eight + speeds in the Japanese ( and even the German ) mainstream line up, some of them still only have 5 speeds in most of their line up. And Chrysler is the one who is offering eight and nine speed transmissions in their lower end cars first, so it is a little unfair to say that the American manufactures are putting technology in their cars, on the other hand I do agree that their high end models ( I.e. Cadillac and Lincoln at least) should have had this technology within a year or two of it appearing on the German makes, and I don't recall that happening so in that respect you are correct."

My previous A4 had the 19"" 35 series tires (and the sport suspension, too) -- you were aware of every grain of sand on the road. The 18""s are 40 series, which are somewhat better since the sidewalls aren't quite as stiff and there is a bit more cushion between you and the road, given the higher/taller aspect ratio.
The potholes here in Cincinnati have multiplied like rabbits this year -- I dread the almost unavoidable consequences of hitting one. Last time I did that it cost me one new wheel and four new tires. On an Audi, everything is breathtakingly expensive. We're talking a number beginning with a 2 -- yikes! Damn potholes.
When I cruise down the highway with these tires, there is very little road noise and, being that the tire sidewalls are only stiff, not super-stiff, the ride is actually not an issue. I do, however, have the upgraded seats, which probably account for part of the comfort, too.
You're right, when you put the car in Sport mode and use the paddle-shifter to blast up and down the highway, the thing really feels like a sports car. The paddles, in fact, in this car, provide the only ""instant"" shift I have ever experienced with any car (I love the S-tronic trans.)

To find the humorous side of my recent situation, I ""uninstalled"" my front license plate holder on my new S4. Left the 4 little screw holes there just in case. If it was on there, I imagine my accident would have caused another .25 man hours of work to repair, as they need to remove and replace the front bumper and grill. I will make sure they make my 4 guide holes though; just in case the CHP forces my hand some day.

1076,markcincinnati,April 2014,"Acura TLX
There are (were) many good things to be said (and enjoyed) about the current TL SH-AWD (in Advance trim) -- trouble is (was) I often found myself ""apologizing"" for the Acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-Honda-ized"" interior.
The concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, I think the same can be said for the Infiniti Q50, too. And, well, talk about piling on -- the Q50 can't get NO love from NOBODY, well maybe a little bit from Popular Mechanics.
I did then and still do today liken the TL in SH-AWD Advance form as Acura's S4 (for a lot less $). Now that I have a '14 S4, I do appreciate it [the S4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the TL SH-AWD remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated TLX. If the price of the TLX SH-AWD Advance can stay under $50K, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the TLX] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing TL (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the Q50, as I recall).
I had thought Acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium Germans and the other premium Japanese offerings. It would seem the TLX could knock the Q50 to last place and maybe even breathe down the IS 350's neck (assuming the Acura in FWD trim is not compared with the IS in either rear or AWD configuration).
Perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the IS was going to be the only current Japanese Premium sporty sedan. This new TLX SH-AWD could turn the corner and the tide for that matter.
I'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (A4, 3 series, C Class, ATS, IS, Q50 etc), there should be NO FWD only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one). Yes, I know the A4 is offered in an FWD configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so Audi dealers I am aware of there are NO, ZERO, NONE, NADDA, FWD A4's (I don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)
The new A3 and the new ""baby Benz 4-door coupe"" may come as FWD models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine. But at the ELLPS (Premium models) RWD and/or AWD are expected -- and here in Cincinnati AWD BMW's look to overtake the RWD versions soon if they haven't already (and the AWD trend is thus in Mercedes, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus for many models).
Having the TLX offered with FWD makes a statement -- something like ""take the 'P' out of ELLPS."" I would think it is a message Acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he said sarcastically -- of the FWD RLX.)
In our fair city, the Honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the Acura store -- I would think some would shop a Honda after seeing the sticker on an FWD TLX. The TLX needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver.
Of course, I could be wrong -- just not uncertain.

Of course, the proof is in the pudding. We won't know what it's like to drive until they hit the streets (May?). My dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when a new model comes out. They have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc. They then have some of the new models for brief test drives. Last one I did was for the RLX (another nice car that's getting little love).
You're an Audi aficionado. I'm a little jaded because of what happened with mine. That shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have.
I'm an Acura aficinado. Through BMWs, Audis, Cadillacs, etc, my Acuras are still among the best cars I've ever owned....and, like you, I've owned quite a few.
Your Audi is based on a FWD architecture. Yes, Quattro alleviates much of the FWD understeer. Still, day=to-day driving? You, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car. They've become quite good at taming those bugaboos.
On paper at least, it looks like the new TLX will have what the Acura folks have been clamoring for.
While the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, I'm more interested in the SH-AWD version, as always. Sticking to the formula of Good/Better/Best (standard/Tech/Advance) I just confirmed with the dealer that the Advance I'll be looking at will come in right around that $49K range (current Advance is $48K and change).
0-60 in 5 sec, Torque vectoring AWD, upgraded materials everywhere, lighter, LED headlights/tailights, high zoot stereo, sports leather seating, blind spot warning, integrated NAV that actually works right (and Siri enabled to fully integrate my iPhone), a little bit of this, a little more of that, at that price?

1080,markcincinnati,April 2014,"Is there anyplace (on the web?) where the number of FWD vs Quattro Audis sold in the US can be found? I've been to Audi dealers in Dallas and there were NO FWD cars other than a TT and the previous model A3 on the lot -- AWD appears NOT to be a regional issue. The highest performance Porsches and Lambos (and even some other Italian exotics) are AWD are they not?
I know that I am an Audi-biased and even German car-biased person, but I would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of FWD Audis of any configuration sold in the US -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of FWD A4s, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%). I think it would be difficult for Audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- Premium status if the cars were in any significant volume FWD. This FWD issue is a problem for Acura.
In the ""old days"" you needed to at least have ONE V8 in your lineup to be considered Premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are Premium class identifiers that Acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew.
They may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be distinguished from their more humble Honda roots. Audis, for years, were often said to be ""higher cost Vw's"" -- an A4 (called an Audi 4000 on this side of the Atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a Passat (called a Quantum) when the Quantum had an Audi 5 cylinder while the Audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. Only when Audi decided to de-VW its cars did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class.
Acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much Honda in their cars -- placing them at the same place Audi was about 20 years ago.
It's time for Acura to get serious, eschewing FWD in the TLX would be a good start-- Acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt.

Fact is, any Quattro A4/6 has it's beginnings as a FWD platform, just like SH AWD Acuras have their beginnings on FWD platforms.
I did rent a Jetta earlier this year. There are similarities to Audi...certain switches, handles, styling (especially the center stack and dash), etc. However, this is true for many brands. I don't see GM making different window switches for Cadillac when they can use the ones from Buick, just as one example.
Is a Honda a ""humble"" basis for an Acura? I dunno....depends on how you look at it. An Accord is certainly a very good starting point for an Acura.
I'm excited about the upcoming TLX. As I normally do, if in a couple of years, I decide to make a trade, the TLX will be tops on my list.
That's based on my experiences with both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. Does that make the S4 a bad car? No, not by a long stretch. It didn't work out all that well for me, and that may mean I have my own biases. But, that shouldn't and hasn't dissuaded you.
We'll wait and see what is unveiled today. I've seen the prototype pics. Acura is pretty good at sticking to pre-release versions of their production models. I like what I've seen. Then again, I liked the previous design, too.
5-sec 0-60, SH AWD, torque vectoring rear, 9 speed trans, Honda reliability, coming in at roughly $10K less than either a 335i or S4 equipped like for like, there's lots to love there.

1086,markcincinnati,April 2014,"Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves?
I shared the story of the S4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife. The first thing she said was ""doesn't someone from Audi read the comments on Edmunds and Audiworld?"" She elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable S4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web.
My own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. You'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the distance to get the customer's issue resolved. If the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, I could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, I would assume, by time) at the problem.
Audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer programs that comb the Internet looking for keywords (the Audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of said interns. Unless they don't have such interns or programs, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing S4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration.
I mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc. So for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, I can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see.
The question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene?
On the subject of separation (by Audi from VW or by Infiniti from Nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the Premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win. Porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of cars that shared way too many VW components -- and those cars were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). Porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively.
These days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the Audi division began to separate itself further and further from VW, Audi's market and machines improved significantly. On the other side of this, Infiniti's G is born with RWD, I know of no Nissan analog, ditto the M -- but the JX was brought to market so quickly Infiniti had to base it on a Nissan product (FWD no less), and despite the JX's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of Infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing.
BMW has no sub-BMW division or parent which can be said to be a strength, but also may put BMW in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum.

2nd problem was how they drug their feet in making a decision on how to proceed. Yes, I had their loaner cars. But, I wanted MY CAR. Then, the Regional Manager tried to do a dance around the issue, denying any problems whatsoever (regardless of the obvious, clearly demonstrable issues).
As the old adage goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"". Audi kind of blew that with me.
The two companies that I've had the utmost positive customer service with has been Acura and BMW. Probably more of a reflection of the individual dealerships than anything else. But, both have gone out of their way to make sure I was happy with my ownership experiences.
After years of not being loyal to any one manufacturer, it's becoming more of a priority for me to deal with the car companies that gives me the best customer service. Of course, to get me in the door to begin with, I have to like their products.
Again, no condemnation of your love of Audis. Your experiences have just been different than mine.

Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves?
The short answer is no. The long answer is no. They don't care. As long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever.
Regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove X, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved. Then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like MMI and such. If it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work. Moreover, complex electronic infotainment systems have a standing ""beta version"" stance. My observation is anytime software is involved, the sellers have some kind of indemnity - all those lengthy and unfair terms of use basically allow them to charge full price for a developmental product. So it goes like that: what da ya want - it's new, complex, it's gremlins, I dunno notin'.

So the simple answer is yes some do. I'm sure some do but don't go as far as actually post. Now, why does GM do it and overtly at that? I don't know. One would like to think that they are trying to improve and/or fix product. But it may just be to cut potential lawsuits off at the pass. Obviously, it hasn't worked perfectly......much like their vehicles."
1090,graphicguy,April 2014,"dino....you are so right. I can't remember how many times I'd call the dealer to ask the status of my repairs. After several days....the answers would be something along the lines of....""we haven't received instructions on how to fix your Audi"", or....""we're waiting for parts. Might take another week"". Or, ""we haven't been given the 'go-ahead' to fix your car"". How is this possible? The car was a year into the alleged ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty. What's to authorize? You fix it.
One of the reasons I won't buy a Cadillac was the way they treated my late Mother. This was several years ago, but my Mother had bought an STS brand new. Granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on Sunday....LITERALLY A CAR DRIVEN BY A LITTLE OLD LADY.
It may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week. It kept draining the battery. Cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery. A week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead.
GM started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my Mother...blaming her for not driving it enough. So, she and I swapped cars. I drove her Caddy every day. Same thing happened when I drove it.
After having it towed yet again to the 3rd Caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"". I asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see WHY the battery was being drained. He said all GM would reimburse them for was a battery replacement.
GM ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after the surge.
When the buy back was authorized, I took the Caddy to the selling dealer as GM instructed. Dropping off the keys to the GM of the dealership, he said he wished he had never sold the car to my Mother.
Know what? So am I. That attitude has kept me away from the brand ever since.

1091,markcincinnati,April 2014,"For the record, it [the Audi S4 issue] was NOT my Audi. As I have stated to distraction, between my personal cars, company paid-for cars and my wife's cars, we've had, er, 31 Audis in our garage since late 1977. They have not all been perfect. Yet, there has never been a problem that Audi has NOT stepped up and fixed (and only one time did an Audi factory rep take a look at one of my cars, and his response was to authorize all new rotors for my braking vibration issues.)
I am NOT suggesting that I know some inside information -- but how do we know the mfgrs aren't paying attention to these posts (and posts made elsewhere)?
I would think the almost 100% vertical ""rise in importance"" of social media would virtually dictate that the mfgrs monitor the WWW for blogs, rants, raves, posts, tweets and so on.
It just doesn't seem likely we are just chatting with each other and that what we say is not even some small part of the mix of ""market research"" and data points that so many companies covet and spend governmental sums to acquire.
We, all of us collectively (via ""the vivid awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society"", C. Wright Mills), can [potentially] ""move markets"" -- especially and unfortunately somewhat easily in the negative, more so than the positive.
Imagine if ""we all"" wrote nothing but ""hater"" tales about the ""DeSoto"" -- you know, pick one car or car company (we could all pile on GM in light of its recent bad publicity, for example) -- that could be dozens (or perhaps thousands) of taste makers in a short time telling the world that ""this [DeSoto] product"" sucks, under-performs, costs too much, drinks gas or costs a young fortune to maintain and spends more time in the dealer's garage than the owner's, for instance.
I would think once what we wrote was posted here and subsequently quoted or re-posted on Facebook or any social media outlet of note, the crud would hit the fan. It seems ""obvious"" (to me) that the mfgrs must be observing what is being said and weighing the requirements to react and/or respond.

1096,sweendogy,April 2014,Good question @michael@edmunds. I would say its always been up to the moderator- acura has had 2 cars here from the beginning and my argument was/is the tsx really Ellps? Obv the word sedan needs to be addressed but I think you need a pricing band- say 30-40k starter (obv that is a huge range but it's something) - and it has to be somewhat sporty - we can all agree the Lexus ES and other fwd rebaged cars should not.

1098,markcincinnati,April 2014,"A3, CLA, 2-Series and who knows what else will come forth?
This forum, nominally, is the Entry-Level LPS forum. There is, of course, also an LPS forum. These names were fine when there was no CLA, A3, and etc. Now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new Mercedes C class is a big move up in its ""Premium-ness"", and even though the A4 (Audi's B class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 A4 will take a page out of the A3's book and be pushed further upscale.
The new TLX (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ELLPS cars.
I never understood what justified the Acura TSX's inclusion as an ELLPS but I accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck.
A discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing cars to be commented on -- and that is fine with me. I do think, however, that the forums that include multiple cars should include cars that are typically cross shopped.
Example: I might have test driven a Ford Taurus SHO when I was looking to replace my TL SH-AWD; but this event was most likely an anomaly. The Taurus SHO is not an ELLPS by any definition I can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the LPS forum.
Therefore, at this point, the A3 and CLA and whatever else comes out BELOW the current A4, 3 Series, TLX, S60, IS, Q50 and so on should merit their own forum.
The other day, I was at my Audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned A3 Premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called Prestige, and one might argue the upcoming S3 might up the ante even furhter). The thing was somewhat MORE expensive than a stripped A4 Premium (quattro) model.
For the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the NEW A3 with the OLD A4 -- the replacement A4 however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as distinctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap A3.
In any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ELLPS cars into their own forum, perhaps something like Premium Sporty Compacts, PSC for short, or Sporty Premium Compacts, SPC, pick something, anything, just not ELLPS unless we make a new class in between ELLPS and LPS.

1100,m6user,April 2014,"Well, entry level is entry level. That definition is pretty clear cut. Sedan is pretty clear cut as well. The only thing that is questionable is the ""performance"" part. But it appears the A3 will perform just as well if not better than the A4. I think that was the hang up with the TSX being included in that it didn't really fit the ""performance"" model in a lot of people's minds. I had no problem with it being included because there are a lot of A4 w/ front wheel drive running around out west and down south that are very close on paper to a TSX. I know most people think of the Quattro when they talk Audi ELLPS but that's a choice of their own.
Doesn't really matter all that much to me. But technically, a lot of the cars that have been traditionally discussed here are no the the performance entry from that particular brand anymore. It's just so complicated isn't it."

Michaeall...I see that same tail light treatment in the ILX, the RLX, and how the TLX. At first, I wasn't sure I liked the LED headlights, as Acura is using them as a design cue. They're starting to grow on me, though. Looks like the tailights are the LCD ""lite pipe"" variety replacing my LED tail lights. That interior is gorgeous.
Saw some other specs....
0-60 around 5 secs for the TLX SH AWD (about 1/2 sec quicker than my current TL SH AWD). MPG is 21/31. I get 21 in the city, now. So, not sure that is an upgrade. But, if the numbers are right, I'm getting 28 MPG on the highway. If they can hit 31 MPG with the new trans, that would be great.
3.5L. 290 HP and about 270 TQ. That HP and displacement is less than my durrent TL (305 HP, 3.7L), but apparently the new 9-speed trans and weight reduction is attributed to the higher performance.
TLX multi-link suspension replaces my TL's double wishbones. Not sure about that. Will have to drive to see how that affects ride/handling.

It can be had with a manual transmission out the door for roughly 5% less then MSRP, if the buyer knows how to haggle with the salesman and over on Bimmerfest, a lot of people know how to haggle.

Agreed. The shield/beak front felt repulsive, at least at first. It kind of grew on a little bit, but was never in a beauty contest. TSX actually looked just a tad better in this beak thing than TL. I also liked previous TSX.
BTW, TSX was a perfect size for me. Similar to older BMWs and Audis. I don't really carry passengers, but I like four doors (actually five). To me back seat size is not as essential, as driving experience, which those shorter wheelbase vehicles provided. Unfortunately, all those names grew to sizes reminding their bigger brothers 10 years ago. I think the whole category really shifted. When you get something like optioned-out 335, A4 or soon coming C-class, they aren't really entry level, they are still ""sporty"", but not really ""sports"". Same would be with CTS, TLX, or others.
Unfortunately, their smaller siblings, which some would now argue as ELLPS, come mostly in FWD setups, which is off for traditionalists. It becomes fact of life. It is true that contemporary FWD is not your mother's FWD - current advances in torque handling made those cars much better to drive. Many have or will have AWD option and better engines, which mitigates some of the issue.

My experiences with Audi have all been positive. Every company can have a bad apple.

That's what happened my first 4,100 miles in the perfect 2014 S4, but a day before I'm supposed to pick it up at the body shop, I'm told the dealer is finding the left front side of the vehicle out of alignment spec, enough out of spec that they can't adjust to meet spec.
The accident was on the right side; this could spell trouble. Not Audi's fault of course, the Lexus driver is at fault. I will say I escaped the ordeal without as little as a bruise; the belt did what it's supposed to do. I'm told the tow truck could have caused the suspension damage.
All the fluids had to be refilled & recharged (coolant, transmission, transmission coolant, AC system). The driver's seat belt has to be replaced (one-time use with significant impacts). The air box had to be replaced. Might end up being more than 17K when all is said and done; I think they should have totaled it; we'll see.

I have been in 5 accidents, 4 in cars (none my fault), one accident, I had to make a panic stop on I-8 west bound from La Mesa to Mission Valley, just picked up our truck from the dealership, truck was 6 months old, had 6K miles on, and a lady slammed into me at 65 mph, lucky for me, the truck was taller then her car, her insurance company was going to fix the truck, it needed a new frame, cost of said frame, $7900, then another $13K to R&R frame. My EX and I fought the insurance company to just total the truck, since the job was going to take roughly 3.5 months to complete.... So after 5 months (it took the dealership 2 months to complete the job) but each time I would take the truck out for a test drive I would find something wrong with the truck, after 5 months, of nit picking her insurance wrote a check for the truck.

The S4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components. It appears the aluminum sub-frame of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right. They said they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs. I think unlike Toyota (in general), an Audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way."" There's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""Audi Certified"" in all of San Diego County. A good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec. They admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right. In a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays. I think they know the typical Audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail. After all, they didn't settle for a VW.
The body shop will get the car back first thing Monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?) After that, he said they had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending).
I hope I don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10K insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value.
When I told Geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10K, then come in afterwards), they balked. They said let's wait and see what Mercury agrees to pay for DV and other things first, then we'll talk. I sent a demand letter to Mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55K (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for DV alone. I added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs. I told them if they force me to go further, I will no longer negotiate the highest of my consultants estimates, whereas right now I might negotiate down a bit to just get it over with.
If there are ongoing issues with the car, I think now is the time to state for the record I thought the car should of been totaled from the beginning. At least then I can say ""I told you so,"" and your adjuster was off by somewhere near 25% (incompetent or grossly negligent estimate).

Finally got the first supplemental estimate: Just north of $20K!!!!
Still, well below totaling even with 15% DV and $1,405 rental costs.
However, I find being off (first estimate was $15.5K) by so much, makes me think someone wasn't being honest with themselves early on. I know supplements are common, but one of nearly 25% extra? 28 day time estimate is way off too. Looks like it'll be 1 month and 4 days if they let me pick up next Tuesday.

1127,andres3,April 2014,"So I got in a fight with my insurance company; I believe they've turned on me and they have 3 strikes in my book now. They found out the impacted tire wouldn't balance on the wheel and had to be replaced. They tried to get away with only replacing 1 tire saying the car only had 4,200 miles. I pointed out to Geico that they were deviating from the Owner's manual and Audi specifications that recommend replacing all 4 tires, but under no circumstances should tires be replaced in less than pairs on the front and/or rear axle. They must be within 2 MM to meet spec from front to rear. After sending a semi-nasty letter to Gieco, they realized the error of their ways, and said they'd pay for 80% of 2 tires, but 20% betterment charge to me (they are within the 2 mm spec.
20% betterment when staggered tires (2/32nd's difference) will result in reduced or at least altered performance? NO THANK YOU. Also, I won't get any betterment because I'm not going to double my maintenance frequency and hassle changing 2 tires at a time, especially when the manual says running different size tires (circumference) will result in reduced handling.

1128,m6user,April 2014,If I were your insurance company I would have the tire shop shave a tire to match up with your present tires and tell you you're good to go. IMO asking for 4 new tires where only one is damaged when the car has only 4200 miles is a reach. Why would you have to double your maint. frequency if the tires are within the 2mm spec. anyway?

They are saying I should pay a 20% betterment charge for getting two new tires replacing two tires that had 80% life left.
My argument is simply that since I want to change all 4 tires at the same time on the same rotation, the extra 2/32nd's on the front tires will provide me no betterment. I'm not going to delay changing the 2 newer tires when the older 2 are due for replacement just so I can eek out a ""betterment."" I will gain no benefit. If your always changing out your tires 2 at a time you are changing them out twice as frequently (in terms of shop visits and down time) than if you just change out all 4 at once.
I can assume and project all 4 tires will wear evenly since the car is AWD and all 4 tires measured at the same 20% wear.

1131,andres3,April 2014,"Bigger problems than tires..... Got the car back yesterday afternoon. In a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, I was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car.
A small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great.
I was expecting all that above and I'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. However, I wasn't expecting the following:
Misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) Haven't measured but I'd say around 3/16"" if I had to guess).
Lower Rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) They admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, Audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in Germany. They suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. Looks aftermarket now.
The exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips.
Number 3 bothers me the most. They say if what you can see is bad and lacks QC, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. Oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired).
On the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. The car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). I'd say the only thing I can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close. When I eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two.

Andres....Just my personal opinion, but I think it's time to go to the insurance company and tell them you need a new car....for all the reasons listed. If they choose to fight (like with the tires, which to me is being rather nit-picky given all 4 tires should have the same tread depth), then you can tell them to give you a new car now, or risk having a car with a salvage title instead after you begin your proceedings.

The other driver was at fault of course. I don't cause accidents, and I'm usually able to avoid them. You have to be a really horrible terrible driver to cause a collision with me.
When I told the adjuster and sent him 5 pictures of the first 5 things I noticed that were wrong (mostly paint scuffs/scratches/chips), he said Geico had paid the body shop, the body shop was my choice, and I'd have to deal with them on paint issues. Basically saying, you are on your own since you didn't choose one of our preferred shops, and our only obligation is to pay for repairs.

I'm liking the idea of having a new car as that's the only way I'll get back to having a German built and assembled S4 which clearly is far superior to one built and assembled in Escondido, CA.
The insurance company seems to think they are off the hook and I need to sue my chosen body shop. I did point out the windshield cowl was on them since it was never on the estimate, and they said they would pay for stuff if it was missed in the original estimates or supplements. How do I get them to see it as potentially their problem again?
How would I go about getting a salvage title if they don't cooperate? I am missing a few links in the chain there. I suppose my argument is that Geico and Mercury's adjuster's erred incompetently in saying this vehicle was repairable for 15.5K in 28 days. 38 days of rental for nearly $1,400, and $20.3K in repairs later, and we are where we are now. I do think I'll contact Audi and let them know this shop should certainly be DE-Certified.

What you are going through absolutely sucks dude. You are being picky and have every right to demand nothing less than perfection from the body shop and insurance company that is fixing a ""dream car"" for you with only 4200 miles which before it got hit was still ""brand new.""
Did you say they cut you a check for diminished value? It just seems at this point that you aren't going to ever be 100% happy with the car. Have them fix whatever else they can, then take the car to CARMAX, take it to a couple of Audi dealers, sell it or trade it in. Even with a ""dirty carfax,"" it is still a low mileage S4.

1143,andres3,April 2014,"On second thought, the car might not be as bad as I first thought. My list can be contained under 20. The door misalignment might only be 1/8"". The rocker panel isn't that bad, its decent work, just not Ingolstad standards. After further review, I wasn't noticing anything else I hadn't already noticed in the first 24 hours (although there was one missed/rough/abrupt shift; not repeatable or duplicatable). If they can get my list right, I think I might just be happy with the car (besides, it'll take 3 to 4 months to get one just like it; as I'd have to re-order it from Germany again). This successful outcome of course depends upon Mercury paying me decent DV, and Caliber Collision/European Autobody paying for a premium rental while they do the RE-work on my list.
The car drives and rides well, so mechanically it feels strong; then again I was flopping around in a meager 4 cylinder Altima for a while and that seemed to pale in comparison to a new Accord, let alone an S4. Forgot how sturdy and tight fitting the seats were too compared to the rental fodder; reminds me to lose weight, or at least not gain any more weight.
The main thing that upset me was the low hanging exhaust that isn't symmetrically low hanging. This is a bad rolling on the road advertisement for Audi, hence why I thought the shop should be uncertified.

Here in Cincinnati, there is ONE body shop that has gone through the Audi A8 (aluminum) certification and actually sent their techs to Germany for training and then to Chicago for follow up training.
I would use this body shop for any car.
Oddly, my Audi dealer does NOT have a body shop, but the dealer is part of a billion dollar dealer group that has a body shop at each of their Cadillac and Acura dealerships.
If I go to the dealer with a body shop need, they used to take the car to the Audi A8 certified shop -- now, unfortunately, they trot it on over to the Cadillac dealership which does a good job.
Good really is the enemy of great.
I had a minor hiccup (a scratch really) and ended up ""demanding"" the car go to the certified body shop. The dealer complied but not before they offered up the Cadillac (or the Acura) body shop.
I had a trim piece lose its luster on my 2009 A4, and Audi agreed to send me all new chrome trim -- since it was under warranty, I let the Cadillac body shop do the job (and they replaced the trim without incident.) There was no body work or painting involved, however.
If you have any Audi product, I urge you to at least investigate ONLY taking the car to an A8 certified body shop -- they seem to have been indoctrinated with the ""doing it the right way"" and good is not good enough philosophy.
Only great is great, despite the extra cost (which is NOT paid out of your pocket, typically.)
I assume such a body shop would also be ""superior"" for any brand since the degree of care required for an aluminum body certified shop certainly seems to be a step or two above and beyond."

Germans nearly 4.5 months, 4,100 miles, and no tow trucks.
Americans assemble and build it and it gets 6 days before a tow truck is needed!
Geico says my problem is that I'm nowhere close to getting a total because the ""repairs"" are cheap in comparison to the car's value. That they have to be consistent, fair, and adhere to standards.
I think I""ll have to fight with them on the definition of ""repairs/repaired.""
This is from one of the most reputable well regarded ""Audi Certified"" body shops in all of San Diego County.
Yes, I think I was right about the Insurance and body shop industry being a racket. One spoon feeds the other in a vicious cycle of lies. This incident coupled with my list of 20 ""issues"" has me fed up. The only thing keeping me sane is the body shop is on the hook for the rental I""m in now, and they were receptive to my issue.
Of course, I realize insurance would be expensive if Every Audi with significant damage had to be totaled the way it should be. Either that, or ship it back to Germany to be fixed correctly.

I don't think CLA is really going to work as well as Audi A3 or 320i. It has the looks, but that is about it. Haven't seen any in Phoenix or Tuscon, but in San Diego, I was surprised on how many I see."

1174,flightnurse,May 2014,Hey Graphic what is the TL running? It's in my BMW.
1175,graphicguy,May 2014,"FN....I'll have to look. Not quite sure what RPMs it runs at 80 MPH. I know the last road trip I took from Cincinnati to Chicago (with a little in town driving-10%) I netted 28 MPG (manual calculations). Buzzing around town, I get about 21-22 MPG.
I've seen a couple of CLAs around here. They're lookers. Sat in one at the local auto show. Not bad, but I wonder if an Accord doesn't have a nicer interior?
A3....a looker also. S3, probably more my speed (literally). Still trying to get over my S4 experience, though.
Still anxious to see the new TLX in the flesh.
And, NYC, I do agree. The ELLPS that are hitting the streets (CLA, A3, 320i, etc) are, generally speaking, an exciting bunch, given their price points.

FN....I think over time, and having had a fair amount of cars in my driving lifetime, it becomes clearer to me in seeing, feeling, and experiencing differences in cars. I'd be hard pressed to pick a CLA over a loaded Accord for less money.....especially given on just about every metric you use, the Accord seems to be the better car.
As you note, however, perception is reality many times. The Genesis is a perfect example of that. I've yet to hear anyone state they went from the Mercedes or BMW dealership over to the Hyundai store to cross shop the 5/E/Genesis. On top of that, the new Genesis is quite the looker in its own right.
BTW...was on the interstate last night. Got the TL up to 80 MPH. It was turning right around 2,100 RPM. While driving last night, I was thinking having had the twin scroll turbo in the BMW and the S/C in the Audi, while not as fast, the 3.7L in the TL spurs on quite well, and sounds expensive to boot.

The 320i is an entry level into a premium brand, just like the A3 is, however, the real difference is, the 320i isn't a smaller car like the A3 or CLA. It's the same F30 as the 328i which means you get a real back seat for two adults, something that the Audi and MB can not claim. This is what is setting BMW apart from Audi and BMW.

I don't think that it's missing so much as it's optional. A base 320i has very few standard features when compared to a top of the line Accord. To get them equipped similarly, the 3-series will end up priced in the upper 30's.

If you sole argument is technology then you should have bought a Q50 and not your S4... If someone wants a strip down Sports Sedan, which BTW, BMW is selling many 320i with just the Sports Package and 6 spd manual that is the way to go.

In your world there are people who don't want all that but want a Sports Sedan, so they order a 320i with Sport Package, with 6 sod man and they are happy.

Dealers are ordering 320i's with Premium Package and leather, that seems to be the bulk of what is on lots. This isn't the lease that is all over the net, but someone who understand leases can get this 320i for roughly $250/m on a lease with very little out of pocket usually tax and fee's."

Though the sport seats have two-way adjustable side bolsters, fully power-operated front seats are extra. Heated seats cost more, too, unless you consider how hot the black leatherette gets after the car sits in the sun for a few hours.

Luxury and performance together.
We will never agree on what constitutes performance, or luxury.
Accord V6 will smoke a 320i - in a straight line.
Sonata limited comes standard with features you have to pay extra for on an A4 - if they are available at all.

1230,Mr_Shiftright,May 2014,"The very term ""luxury performance"" is tricky--in one way of looking at it, they are at odds with each other, in another way, why can't you have both in equal measure?
For some, having a howling engine and gobs of feedback through your ears, hands and butt are anathema to ""luxury"", to others, any car lacking such things cannot be regarded as a ""performance"" car.
I hate to bring up ancient history but in this case it might be relevant. When Mercedes first starting getting serious about capturing the luxury car market in America (by serious, I mean, large sedans, leather, wood trim, AC, automatic, plenty of gadgetry, plenty of power)--this would be in the very late 1960s, early 1970s---they ran into some serious marketing problems with former Lincoln and Cadillac owners.
What was that? It was a lot of complaints about ""these cars ride too hard"" and/or ""the shifting i too firm"" and ""the seats are too stiff"".
What the American drivers were experiencing was ""performance"" --excellent brakes, precise handling and a rational cockpit designed to help you drive fast."

1232,markcincinnati,May 2014,"Been so busy for weeks! Promised myself I would at least make a post when the '14 S4 reached 10,000 miles. Well, I'm about 400 miles away from 11,000 and I need to report to the collective that once again Audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong, reboots itself somehow around 5,000 miles into a stronger (and more economical) version of itself, then settles in for another 5,000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version.
My wife's SQ5 also has passed 10,000 miles and I am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8-speed tiptronic transmission and my 7-speed s-tronic.
In a nutshell: the 8-speed seems, to me at least, to offer the most balanced (of the attributes comfort and sport) presentation of goodness in ""D"" -- the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap, although the downshift rev-matching seems to be, hmm, ""muted"" or somehow pushed out of the foreground. Conversely, the S4 in ""D"" seems hell-bent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon. Also, the s-tronic, in ""D"" really doesn't seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down.
In ""S"" mode, the S4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque, a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt. Also, in ""S"" mode the S4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful ""burp or fart"" sound upon up-shift, time after time. The s-tronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact.
When I got into the SQ5 the other day, I felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts (which it did virtually all of the time, except when I pressed it hard, not to). The slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the s-tronic can also provide velvety shifts, but they are just ""this much"" smoother somehow -- shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt. The differences are subtle when you're pressing lightly on the right pedal, but even the masterful Audi transmission programmers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the s-tronic's slick moves.
The sport seats in both Audi ""S"" models continue to impress with no break-in or break-down of any kind perceptible -- and, the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time I spent sitting behind the wheel of a Premium+ A3 (didn't get to drive it, however.)
The technology too is impressive, even though the choice of T-mobile as the in-car WiFi carrier (3G with very poor signal quality about 1/3rd of the time and 2G with even worse quality the rest of the time) impresses like a turd in a swimming pool.
I have repeatedly asked Audi for an upgrade to another carrier (AT&T, Verizon, cup and a string), I have to assume there is something that (for some fee) could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular carrier ever (at least in SW Ohio). Of course when you get behind the wheel of a new A3 you notice NO T-MOBILE this time around. You can bet by 2016 all Audis will be divorced from T-Mobile. I'd keep my subscription if they'd price it in synch with its usefulness, perhaps $7.50 per month (in SW Ohio anyway). Instead they want $30 per month on a month-to-month basis.
That fellow ELLPS lovers is the only flaw in other-wise delightful pair of ""S"" Audi cars.
BTW - went to the Porsche dealer: finally they had ONE Macan S in stock -- hideous color combo, black on black on black (wheels), gawwd I thought goth was dead (I crack myself up).
However, we do want to drive the Macan to see how the SQ5 holds up against it pound for pound and dollar for dollar.
As always, drive it like you live."

1234,markcincinnati,May 2014,"Nope. Porsche engine, transmission -- lower HP and torque than SQ5 but offers the ability to option to over $90K with a super high output turbo V6 not offered by Audi.
SQ5 lifted ground clearance; Porsche ground clearance in ""hunker mode."" 33% of the Q5 lives on in the Macan. Offers from Porsche a seemingly price competitive version of the SQ5, if you play with the configurations possible, however, the Macan does cost more. The presumably typically optioned Macan S at the Porsche dealership (which owns the Audi dealership too) was about $64K. My wife's Prestige SQ5 was $63.5K or something close to that. An argument could be made that the Prestige SQ5 with several upgrades is still less ($5K) than a comparably equipped Macan S.
I would think, however, if you're looking at the two at sub $65K, the Macan may present itself as, well, a Porsche! And, even if the Audi is the ""deal"" it is still NOT A PORSCHE.
I would want to drive both and I would want to be fair with the option set up.
I am an Audi fan, to be sure, but the Macan could cannibalize the SQ5 -- not the mainline Q5's, the SQ5. Either Audi needs to up the ante (an RSQ5 perhaps) or be relegated to a rung lower in the giant pecking order in the automotive sky.
Funny, Audi has registered the name RSQ3, but as far as I can find out, NOT the RSQ5 -- can you say ""Marketing!"""

For the price point it's the entry level Sport Sedan that can he had with a manual transmission and sport package.
Oddly enough, if you're comparing a base model 320 to other options, the various ""Muscle Cars"" can be had with more options. They handle just as well and offer RWD and a manual transmission if you want it. And for as much as $5K less. And we're not even getting into VW, Infiniti, and others, which also usually come with large year end incentives.
I know this forum is about Luxury Performance cars, but the fact is that the 320 simply is so dreadful in its base form that it's not even as nice as a Civic EX. Now, with the bigger engine and more options, it's a great car, but anyone looking for a $30K or under car has a plethora of better choices."

1240,markcincinnati,May 2014,"A part of the reason folks buy the LPS and ELLPS cars is ""the logo."" Yep, you can almost always find something that seems to equal and often better the ""LPS"" and/or ""ELLPS"" -- call it whatever you want (including brainwashing), but folks frequently look at a fairly large swath of the market and then end up with a ""fill in the blank"" because it is a ""fill in the blank.""
I would suspect, as a somewhat related example, that the Macan S might cannibalize the SQ5's sales (especially if there are Macans on the lot for under $60K), because the Macan is a Porsche.
My friend, thinking he had an a-ha moment bought a Passat CC thinking he got so much more than he would have gotten (in this case) in an A4. Now, the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his Consumer Reports Clinical assessment of the two vehicles.
Perhaps ""hate"" is too strong of a word, but -- he hated the CC -- because it WASN'T an Audi. Same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a Nissan instead of an Infiniti, they couldn't wait to early terminate the lease.
Several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with y'all -- but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who ""saw the light"" and finally got the Infiniti instead of the BMW and then, almost immediately, was pining for a BMW (which would have been seriously de-contented when compared to the Infiniti -- which cost less money too.)
I sat in (didn't drive) a maxed out Avalon and sat in and drove the Lexus ""ES,"" concluding the Avalon was mo' car for less money. Now, in my case, I have little if any affection for the Lexus brand vs the Toyota ) Avalon -- so I would think of myself as opting for the Avalon seeing no advantage to the Lexus that would justify an extra charge.
But, somewhere back in back of my mind, I know so many ""top class"" folks who practically worship Lexi, so were I to be faced with the choice, I imagine I would ultimately cave (and opt for the Lexus.)
Funny (well sorta), I'll buy Kroger Brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the Kroger Brand (pasta for instance) is cheaper. I buy Costco shirts for crissakes, but I wouldn't own a Costco gas grill -- gotta be Weber.
The badges on cars and many other things (and yes we do need those stinkin' badges) are quite an important part of selecting, buying, financing and ""enjoying the ride"" [of the new 'sheen.]

So basically it has to have 4 doors at the expense of every other option and criteria? I can so live with two less doors and 10K less money spent for a car that drives better. (0-60 in 5.7 seconds vs 6.7?) The base model 3 series is just such a disappointment. 60 less HP just turns it into a slug that feels like you're driving an E30 with a almost thousand pounds added. Oh, wait...
And they make you pay for everything including color paint. The article mentioned above didn't clarify that your choices without spending $550 extra were plain black and white. Not just non-metallic paint, but spray-can basic black or white to add insult to injury.
$10K less and two fewer doors... If you need that easier back seat entry and exit that badly, you're better off just getting a SUV or a Camry.
Also, of note was the test of a V8 mustang vs a M3 that was done a while back. The reviewer gave the ""win"" to the M3, but it was 0.02 seconds around a track with everything turned off in the hands of a racing driver. And a loss of 6+ seconds(!) with the normal driving assists turned on (same driver - ouch). Given the vast price difference, it was clear that the ""muscle cars"" of today don't handle anything like their namesakes.
Sporty and performance? I'd take one of those ""muscle"" cars, add leather and all the goodies, and live with two less doors. And still be less money than a 320i with nothing on it."

No. The point is 4-doors + RWD + new. That's the equation we keep talking about.
I agree with the comment that the X1 > 320i. But, yeah, I guess it doesn't precisely fit the sedan category.
EDIT: I just checked on X1 pricing ... you can't get a 28i sdrive with a manual trans?? Ugh.
And its not just a matter of living with 2 fewer doors. Even if I cut 2 more holes in my Mustang, it would not make the back seat much more inhabitable.

I know you are happy with your 320i. I believe you said you have even chipped it to make it faster for a not so unreasonable amount of money. I'm not knocking the 320i. I had one as a loaner once. For my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine. Around town I found it comfortable and docile. It rode smooth on the highway. I'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi. I did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers. I don't like the MASSIVE headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard. I even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the X1. I was simply stating that dollar for dollar, you get better acceleration on an X1 28i vs. a 320i and an X1 35i vs. a 328i.
I know that BMWs even in their ""base"" form are better driving cars than their competitors. Our 1st BMW was my wife's 2007 X3 that had 3 options: Heated Seats, Rear Privacy Glass, & Metallic Paint. We loved it. The fact that BMW offers a 320i with a dedicated RWD platform sets them apart from the competition.
I think it is amazing that a dealer stocks a 320i with a 6 speed stick & sport pkg. Around here, the cars all have X Drive and an automatic (I know why, I took my Prelude yesterday forgetting that it was a ""get away day""). A Sports Package around here with our Texas sized pot holes and crumbling roads is a no-no.
There are faster cars in the price range (Sonata Turbo, V6 Accord) for even less money. There are cars that offer more luxury features & gadgets for less money too. Just because they are faster, more powerful, and offer more gadgets doesn't make them better cars at all.

1259,tlong,May 2014,"Honestly sometimes the snobbery stereotypes of BMW drivers are apparent even in this forum. Really, your car doesn't measure testosterone levels.
I'm not particularly a huge fan of BMW, but I can admire their vehicles and what they've done in the marketplace.
To me, being ""sporty"" is NOT about horsepower or torque. Sure, that's nice, but if that were what was important I'd buy a Vette or a Camaro. Straight-line acceleration is not what makes an ELLPS appealing to me.
I admire and appreciate, shall we say, ""precision"". I like precise, tight steering. I like a reasonably comfortable, yet firm and precise ride. I like going around corners, not at 0.8g, but in a way that the steering feel is precise, I know exactly where the car is going to go, and I can feel the feedback through the steering wheel. I don't even particularly care to autocross my vehicles or pull high g's in corners.
So I also like a ""nice"" interior. I can get fairly lower-horsepower, ""precise"" vehicles at reasonable cost (the Mazda 3 comes to mind). But those vehicles usually don't have the ""nicer"" interiors that I like. It was all of these thoughts and characteristics that caused me to buy an A4 in the late '90's. And now I drive an '05 TL, and you know what - although the interior is ""nice"" and the horsepower is quite good, the driving dynamics are still a bit too floaty/boaty and lacking.
So I DON'T begrudge somebody liking a 320i. It's not all about testosterone, or horsepower, at least to some of us. And it's not about snobbery, either. We all have different needs and tastes. Insulting each others' rides - well, pretty childish IMHO."

I couldn't agree more. I just traded in my BMW 335d (M-sport package) and got a BMW 320i (Sport package) and I am loving it.
I was looking at other similar cars in the price range - Audi A3 2.0, VW GTI, Honda Accord, but none of these came close to fun that I had when I test drove the 320i with Sport package. I would have been able to get more standard options with all other models, but none of them came close to the handling and nimbleness that was there in the BMW (my opinion).
I also looked at 328i (Sport line and no line). The 328i Sport line was definitely faster compared to 320i, but only if you went at it hard. In normal to mid range driving (which is what I normally do), I found really no difference. 328i without sport package felt too soft.
I am actually having more fun driving the 320i than I had in my 335d, which had much higher HP and gobs of torque."
1262,dino001,May 2014,"I just attended BMW's drive event with 4-series, C350 coupe, S5 and Lexus IS. I drove 435 with Msport line, Benz and Audi. All three are very nice. S5 felt sportiest of them, the DSG shifts made sounds like computer game. Its supercharged engine had phenomenal note. Benz was plush, well balanced, still quite quick. BMW had everything in great balance, the sports suspension was what I like. The exhaust note more throaty than I remember on 335 I drove during the performance delivery in Spartanburg. They also had 428 Gran Coupe on display. It's gorgeous. Back seat headroom is too small for 6 feet tall person, but the extra utility of hatch is great. Love the looks. Couldn't drive it, as that one was preproduction European model, even had manual transmission, not available for US market. It's definitely on my list, but I'm not rushing in to put a deposit down.
BTW, I had a great conversation with the product rep about some features. They reportedly changed the start/stop feature defaulting to last setting, as opposed to previous always going back to active. It is reportedly US market only, in Europe they kept the old one due to carbon emission garbage. The shaking on restart is reduced and also depends on which cylinder restarts first.

1266,plekto,May 2014,"OK, let's get serious for a minute. 4 doors and leather and nav and doesn't suck at handling?
I put every option that I could find on a Focus ST, plus the special paint, moonroof, and so on and got a Truecar price of $27K.
4 doors. Handles better, looks better, is faster. Almost 335i fast, in fact. Those full leather Recaro seats are also very comfortable, despite their color scheme. So if you want more performance, you have a better option for less money.
Or you can go the other way and want more luxury and better performance for the same money. Auto magazines compare the 335i and the G37 routinely. I think the poor 320i will end up roadkill vs even the base model G37.
It's not that BMW doesn't make good cars, it's that they did the same thing that Lexus did with the miserable IS250. It's so weak, bland, and uninspiring to drive compared to the bigger version that it really doesn't deserve to be in any category other than ""next""."
1267,sweendogy,May 2014,"@plekto - forget about it- as flight explained in his genesis comments from May, its about brand has nothing to do with what you actually get. I would ask flight he bought a 320 while his partner got a genesis- 2 cars that are very close in price but far in spectrum."
1268,justg0,May 2014,"@plekto‌ - Focus ST or G37 or GTI all are very nice cars in terms of handling and performance. I think it comes down to personal preference in what you like.
So who would pay BMW premium to get a 320i with lower horsepower? I am quoting from an article that I read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.U4odyagWeG0):
Beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. The 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the 328i, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. The two cars are virtually indistinguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. Why pay more?
That's me going from a BMW 335d to 320i. I save $200 per month on my lease and I am actually having more fun with the 320i. Maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise.
I could have gone with Focus ST or G37 and saved some more money (for some reason the GTI and A3 lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with BMW, since having had it before, I knew exactly what I was getting - a RWD sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the city."
1269,sweendogy,May 2014,"Don't mind the above response understandable wanting to save money, and get a rwd sedan & if you can due it with weather, but is this car a ELLPs under that configuration, no it's not - Lexus once sold a RWD is250 that could be had with a 6 speed - they sold it as a performance sedan- no one bought this configuration or cared- even caddy which is aiming big time at the bmw has a similar priced car and a base engine with similar weak power but neglected to give us the manual because it's not a real draw with the weaker engine-non-turbo, it's more of a pricing thing I guess. Real performance seekers would never opt for the 4 cyl 180 non turbo- it's bland. Also real lux seekers would never opt for a pleather, base stereo, no power seat car - doesn't add up- car is not Ellps. And at the bargain price of 35k really? And done"
1270,dino001,May 2014,"Have you even driven it, Sweeny? How do you know it's so bad and weak? I have not driven it myself, perhaps my next service visit I get a chance, if dealer finally turns that 328 loaner inventory. I must say, I rather believe a guy who actually drove it and wrote that article that said this 320 reminded him the old 325 he actually owned (which has been basically a benchmark defining the category in its balanced design), rather than a guy who looks at some number tables and proclaims the thing not being worthy his time.
BTW, isn't it interesting that today's car having track time of 1988 M3 (just 26 years) can be seen as having a ""weak engine""? Sure, things evolved and expectations today are somewhat different then 20+ years ago, but perhaps we went a bit too far. It is true that the competition honestly caught up with BMW in lot of aspects of that category, a lot of that started in arms race in brochure values of the horsepower, or straight line accelaration numbers combined with adding nice stuff to it. It is a new reality. Over 200 horses, 3000 lbs, we still complain too little of thise or that. Consumer is the king. BMW themselves also evolved in direction that many think lost some original appeal. But I simply cannot take your argument that just because some numbers don't align with your idea what ELLPS should be, it doesn't belong. Until I actually sit inside and try it, I don't know.

You're dead wrong stick, the guys who have only read about E39s know MUCH more about them than than you do! Two of my BMWs have 150 bhp or less and they are two of my all-time favorite cars to drive. In fact, I still use the Club Sport at HPDEs; my students are amazed at how fast an ""underpowered car"" can go when driven properly.
On the other hand, I have a hot hatch that puts over 300 bhp through the front wheels. It is also fun, but in an entirely different way.
Of course many of the ""experts"" in this topic would dismiss all three cars because-oh the horror!-none of them have full leather power seats. The seats are extremely comfortable and have outstanding lateral support, but those attributes pale in comparison to the ability to push a button and move your seat 1mm forward or back...

I think its worth it for people looking for that extra hp. Its the same argument when going from 328 to 335. Is that extra hp worth the premium you pay? Only the person buying can decide that for themselves.
Another thing is that in reality the difference comes out to be more like $100 or more. The moment a dealer gets a car with Sport line or M Sport, they put some much other stuff that the car gets lot more expensive. I was hard pressed to find a 328i with just Sport line and nothing much more. So unless you are willing to custom order and wait, you would end up paying much more.

I can bet 90% of people who buy the cars in the ELLPS category, whether BMW, Audi, Lexus, Mercedes, etc. get automatic (and also probably have never seen this forum). I haven't looked at any data on this, so if someone has anything to support or refute this, would appreciate that. I am just going on based on what I found on dealer lots when I was looking. So, in that case none of these cars would qualify to be a ELLPS, we might as well close this forum down
And yes, I did get an automatic, but that's my personal preference. BMW does make it available in manual like their other 3 series."
1280,m6user,June 2014,"If this was a forum about ELPS one would expect no power seats, no leather, no sunroolf, no high tech in the dash, etc. But most buyers, when they are looking for a luxury car, expect those kinds of things. Hard core rally guys could probably care less as all they really care about is does it run and is it fun to drive. But when one positions the discussion to talk about entry level LUXURY PERFORMANCE sedans then at least a moderate level of luxury should be expected or we might as well include Mazda6s and Honda Accord V6 in the discussion. Luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate.
The reason why many on here were opposed to the TSX being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down. However, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it.
I think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with. Some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn't come with it I don't need it or if I don't need it to shift gears, what good is it"". Not direct quotes but silly just the same."

I have no doubt of the times, so moving up to a 328i over a 320 has to be more then just HP, there are other options that are only available on the 328 and not on the 320i.

The article above said it perfectly...
""here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money.""
There's a harsh bit of reality in all of that, though. The type of driver who is all of that will be buying the car with automatic virtually 100% of the time.(barring some oddball statistical freak who you find to come here on this forum just to dispute this)
So no manual. But, wait... everyone says that to be ELLPS it has to have manual...
So are we talking ""offered with manual so that I can say it qualifies, despite that nobody buys this model with manual"" or ""It's not the real thing unless it has manual - let me show you the pictures""?
So... no manual, no power, no luxury, and 30K?
Tell me how this qualifies. All I get out of this equation is ELS... Entry level sedan. If we are to believe that article, the driver who is satisfied with that for their daily driving needs would probably be happy with anything if it had the right badge on it to impress their co-workers for a few seconds.
P.S. I'd like to see the person who has one here answer me that question:
Manual or Automatic in your 320i?
"" performance"" can mean handling, too. Does it corner like a BMW? Does it have the same suspension?

Yes, its the same. You can get the Sport package, which gives it the M Sport suspension and M steering. But you can't get DHP, I think for that you need to get 328."

If it is so cost effective and does absolutely no harm, I wonder why BMW doesn't just offer it as an upgrade under warranty for about triple the price and make all that much more profit. Seems like a no brainer for BMW. Seems like there is more than meets the eye here.
The same could be said why does BMW only offer the Performance Pack for the 335 and not the 328. Over in Europe BMW has a Performance Pack for all boosted engines.

They don't have to wiggle out of it... ""We show four examples of overboost, and now you have an internal engine failure and we deny your warranty claim"".
Unless your brother is a lawyer and works for free, you'll be out of luck. Don't get me wrong.. I wouldn't presume to suggest this is likely to happen. Just that your warranty won't be any good, if they can tie anything to your modifications. And, they don't have to ""prove it"". They can just refuse to fix it.

Hypertech's tune for the Mazdaspeed 3/6 is relatively safe because it doesn't push the small stock turbo past its limit of efficiency; I''ve only heard of one engine failure on a HT tuned car. This is almost certainly due to the fact that the tune cannot be modified by the end user- unlike the COBB AP or Versatune tuning devices; a little knowledge can prove to be very destructive...

Yep...I did. At the time I had it done, they had a ""special"" on the upgrade ($600). I added a dealer coupon to it, and I think I ended up paying $200 for it. The good news there, it was covered by BMW's warranty. Don't know if they still offer that upgrade. Don't know why they wouldn't, though.
As I look back, the situation that pushed me to get rid of it wasn't ideal. That's a car I wished I still had ('11 E92). Handled well....muscle car fast....comfortable....good looking.....didn't give me an ounce of trouble.

1317,qbrozen,June 2014,"I ran JB4 by itself for a while. (Then camber plates.) It was Ok for a few months, then started triggering limp mode once a week or so. Dealer replaced coils, plugs, and fuel pump (this was the car's second fuel pump) across 3 different trips for the limp mode problem. Seemed OK for a little while again.
After 1 track event where the car was plagued by overheating, I added a custom larger oil cooler and downpipes (thought maybe deleting the cats from so close to the engine could help with heat). But then the vanos solenoid problems began. While on my 3rd set of those, the car started making some very disturbing but faint noises from down deep within, so I gave up, quickly removed the downpipes and tuner, and traded her in. Total ownership period was 18 months.
With the JB4 by itself, I think they were claiming 340-350 hp, IIRC. With the DPs, it should have been somewhere in the 370hp range. Some folks were pushing far more through the N54 engine, but I didn't feel the need for that much. It was damned quick, and a great deal of fun when running right. I'm pretty sure, even in stock form, though, it wouldn't have been a reliable car in the long run.

Well I last posted on May 29. Whew! I think I am finally caught back up on the reading of the many -- mostly very good -- posts.
I have some take-aways that comes from speed-reading about 60 posts AFAP:
Talking with specificity about cars you haven't driven is like critiquing a movie after only seeing the trailers -- that's a good one, I will be swiping that with great enthusiasm and some frequency.
Going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been said/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. Not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like cars) have tended to be better along with the passage of time.
Stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2. Oh, somewhere I read that even in cars -- like the ELLPS's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%. Now that I have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, I know the reason. If the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irresistible.
Some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!""
Continuing:
In my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!""
To make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: My MontBlanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (I'll say) pens. In the same spirit, my Tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 Swiss Army Watch I got at Macy's. That's not the point -- well, OK, it may be ONE point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more."" Once I get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, I'll get a KIA of some sort.
I like coming back after a few days to see how we've advanced the discussion here.
I'm really gonna try to test drive more cars, 'cause y'all are BRUTAL!

1327,sweendogy,June 2014,"The value of a money I guess means different things to different people. Acura at one time was a superior value to other lux cars and offered performance- still does-- now the mainstream cars, many of which use the same components as lux siblings cost thousands less and similar performance but I guess should not be compared because of a badge. 750 Macy watch sounds good to me, my timex just broke."
1328,markcincinnati,June 2014,"I do like, very much, my Victorinox Swiss Army watch -- I think it, in some ways, looks nicer than the Tag. But, the thing is, the Victorinox is not a ""luxury"" watch. A new Malibu LTZ (a very attractive looking car), is also not an Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Audi, Mercedes -- it even doesn't fit in the same class as the Volvo S60.
We're here -- well some of us are -- in ELLPS land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an LPS automobile. Perhaps some of us -- as Alfred Sloan imagined -- would start with a Chevy and aspire to a Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and ultimately a Cadillac. I suspect Sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to cars.
We're here, I'll bet, because we either aspire to an ELLPS, have an ELLPS and aspire to an LPS or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from Audi, BMW, Infiniti, etc.
I was wondering today when the last time I saw a Phaeton was -- years ago is all I could come up with. Saw several A8's today, however. I test drove a Phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder I owned an A8) thinking I could get a ""new A8"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the Phaeton. The Phaeton was, closed eyes, an A8. Same sweeeet 4.2L V8, quattro (well, you know) etc. I just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain I'll ever see. Damn HUGE-[non-permissible content removed] ""VW"" emblem on the thing.
Instead of the bargain it probably was, I knew I would be thinking, ""I paid THIS MUCH for a VW?!? What was I thinking?""
You know I still think if you can't or won't go with an S4, the next best thing is the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (and I assume the TLX is even better). Even my non-car loving friends called my TL ""a Honda."" Slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the Acura brand had slipped from Premium status.
My wife collects pens -- I have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- I probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure MontBlanc, but I do notice when I see Brian Williams use one on the air. My MontBlancs (3 of them) are all the pens I need (one of them broke and I had to send it to Germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new). My wife must get 6 new pens per year. I sort of get it. Until her current car (the SQ5 Prestige), she liked cars, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them.
Get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a Subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty. I knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (Meat Loaf).
Now, however, she is ""into cars"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an Audi or a BMW -- I can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact).
Anyway, this collection of ELLPS cars is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom. It is here that we see innovation (often before the LPS offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line.
Remember the Phaeton, long live the Phaeton.

On paper a decked out Hyundai Sonata Turbo has the power, leather, panoramic moonroof, fancy bells and whistles that most of these ellps have but every switch, piece of leather. undercarriage part, latch, hinge, carpet etc etc is cheap compared to these cars. Other mainstream brands may be a little better but still don't approach the luxury brands. The dealer experience is not the same either. I had an Infiniti and have an Acura but have had tons of non-luxury brands and the dealer experience is much different. Yes, you pay for it but that is my point."
1330,sweendogy,June 2014,"Funny you mention the phaeton - what's the view on the genesis (k900)- or was the vw to early to this party- or better yet was the vw to costly to begain with-or does the Kia not work because of the badge. vw started at 60 and went to 100k -had issues with reliability and was not marketed well, but as mentioned here as they might redo it for sale. - so maybe not totally forgotten.

Really.- come on enuf of the better then now stuff- the title of the segment is entry level - so dollars make sense - enjoy the 1k pens - some of us like bics and would spend the extra 1k on a upgraded radio.

1334,markcincinnati,June 2014,"Sween,
Small correction, I used the term ""strokable"" in my post, I'm not sure how it got translated to ""stokable"" -- I meant, by strokable, cars that are as described in the next post by 'm6user' who continued and gave an additional example of the point. Also it was a rip-off of a Wayne's World throwaway line by Mike Meyers.
Also, yes, these are entry-level LPS cars and they can be less expensive than the next step up. However, many if not all of these ellps cars can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. So while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the MSRP scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials.
OK, the forum is about cars, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or expressed sarcasm or irony are misplaced. In response to the shopper who configures a Ford Taurus SHO and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $X-thousands, I had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. Some folks only buy Rolex's (not me, FWIW) and some see not one bit of extra value in a Rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. Some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new Mercedes C -- but might spring for the MontBlanc.
If someone wants to ""prove"" than a Subaru WRX is the equivalent of or superior to a BMW 335 X-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it. The WRX, for all I know, may actually out-accelerate the Bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the Subie an ellps or lps by any stretch.
Anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, I'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions.
I do not, however know what ""enuf of the better then now stuff"" means. These cars, I think we all mostly agree, are better ""now"" than ""then."" I guess several of the reviews of the Q50 have suggested that it did not improve upon the G37 -- which may be what you were referring to.
We may all have our definitions of ellps or even luxury for that matter, which is why I say, most of the time, ""Drive it like you live. . . ."""

We appear to be a verbose, well-educated, fair and friendly bunch. I enjoy this topic, and topics in a similar vein. Watches and cars are a bit related, as several car mfgs and watch mfgs have affiliations, e.g. Breitling/Bentley, Porsche Design, Ferrari/Girard Perregaux. Heuer and racing. Heck, Autoweek regularly writes articles about watches for drivers and regarding auto affiliations.
Just my humble opinion, but these forums should be fun and informative. Marktheredsbengal's posts generally are just that.

Indeed.
If one enjoys life, much of what goes on here is perfectly acceptable, especially Mark's verbose missives (which he's been posting for far longer than those who keep this particular board's numbers up). I've been reading his posts for well over a decade and generally find them enjoyable and/or useful.

1337,sweendogy,June 2014,"Marks comments stand on own, you can love them or question them- I generally love his posts and they usually add something. He's long at times and trys hard to explain things in verbose commentary which is his style. The ego driven explanation on LUx is nothing but rude, well educated in writting sure but let's be real- no one needs to know about the 4 1k pens one ones .maybe he was ""stroking"" his ego.- I understand people here are drawn to badges, I'm a city person who grew up in a modest environment and we are on an ELlps forum- this is not a BEntley forum- the category started with value oriented lux performance cars, entry level. From post One on this board I have always stressed the dollar as being a major factor when comparing cars, research and overall drive as well. That's why I don't understand the puppet mentality of some who just follow the badge."
1338,markcincinnati,June 2014,"I would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the Premium or Luxury class (especially where cars are concerned). Folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps cars with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, I assume we all stipulate $X dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new IS 350, etc). I would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and I assume we do. If, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a Chrysler 300 -- and there is NOTHING wrong with that.
The reason the Escalade (for example) exists is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the Caddy over the lesser GM offerings that lack the Wreath and Crest. Of course there are substantive differences (between the Cadillac and the GMC for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins ARE much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder.
Perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but I'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive MSRP's there will probably be no shortage of takers. Who would have thought an X6 would have a market -- well, not me. And, much as I love Audis, I test drove -- back to back -- an A6 and an A7 and until I opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, I kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the A7 commanded.
They can't keep the A7's in stock. If you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer A7 sales ""if you axe me!""
I have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), I ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself. Like laurasdada, I see the ""value"" of the Omega or the IWC or the Tag, I also appreciate the Invicta and the Swiss Army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""MSRP"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder.""
Of course, I am often wrong, but seldom uncertain.

In other, words people buy what they want. They don't care if other people don't think that ""it"" is worth the price. Conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper. And it's all good.
There is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ELLPS? Honestly, I don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. Many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what... The line will always be blurred and they move. Yesterday's luxury is today's standard. Yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. Prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30K car is today's 40K. And so on. If somebody cross shops Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX/STI with BMW 328i and somebody else cross-shops Lexus ES (not even IS) with same BMW, who am I to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them? They'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ELLPS, but who cares.
I say something much more revolutionary - ELLPS is dead, there is no ELLPS. There is bunch of former ELLPS, but they got so diverse that it's too wide. Some lost ""Entry Level"" pricing (long time ago, I might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""Entry Level"" luxury. Then bunch of outsiders got to the 0-60 and horsepower game, keeping to horses on front wheels, but hey, it's still 250+ horses. There is also a small breed of AWD (some are FWD) bandits that are ""too small"" or don't have enough ""stuff"", but 30 years ago ""real"" ELLPS were just their size, had lesser 0-60, slalom time, crank windows, cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ELLPS.

1341,flightnurse,June 2014,"Mid last year on a flight from Detriot to Miami my seatmate struck up a conversation with me regarding cars (I have all of the car mag's on my iPad.) His questions were odd, but focused. He asked what kind of car I had, when I told him none at moment, asked why, and if I'm in the market for a car. After about 20 minutes I asked him what he did. Come to find out he works for Intellishop, then we started talking about mystery shoppers and such. He asked if I would be interested in being a mystery shopper, but declined, but knew someone who would, Rick. We talk about him and my seatmate was happy. So for the past year Rick been a mystery shopper for Intellishop, this is where the testing of cars come from. It's been interesting so far the Kia K900 and E350 have been standouts, maybe not in the way you think.
K900 is a home run, but the biggest issue is getting people who can afford a $66K car to come into the dealer or think about Kia.
E350, the saleman was the worst but the car he showed us was absolutely stunning, the color combo worked on the car. That is the only positive thing Rick said about the whole MB experience. We weren't even offered a test drive, and haven't driven a E class in several years I was looking forward to it.
In regards to cross shopping, the Kia dealer ask this when we looked at the Cadzena and K900, no other dealer ask this question.
The interesting thing about Intellishop is you have a ""script"" already going into the dealership, and a certain car to look at. At the MB dealer, we had to look at the E350 ""gas"" so the new E350 Bluetec was out of the question, but really want to test drive this car...
This whole debate on what is and isn't a ELLPS is really a subjective thing, just like in the medical word, pain is a subjective. I had patients who would complain of the worse pain of their life, but couldn't keep theirs eyes open because of the heavy doses of pain medications they were on...
I'm with Dino, the ELLPS is dead, since one can buy a $27K hatchback that does 0-60 in the same time as a car that cost twice as much from the homeland."

it's like buying watches do you need the Tag if you have 3k when you can get a macys watch for 750 (with coupons less) and that said watch for 750 actually looks and performs better then a 3k tag? They both have the same warrantee - sure the dealer experience could be better at the tag dealer - but most people would rather not spend time at a dealer, unless they are getting paid."
1345,flightnurse,June 2014,"The K900 is NOT a sports sedan lets get that out first. The K900 (which I really hate the name) was impressive, the 5 liter V8 has plenty of power and has a nice rumble to it, but nothing too loud, just enough to let you know it's there. The 8 spd transmission is the same unit in BMW (but of course gearing and software differences) shifts very smoothly and never had a problem with that. The Kia dealer came to our house with it (this was part of the scrpit from Intillishop) and the salesman (specially trained to sell K900s) was very good explaining the car to us, and he used certain ""key phrases"" when pointing features of the car. So just driving around town, the V8 is right in the smack of it's torque band. Merging onto the freeway the K900 moves well, but not as well as one would think with 420hp. The K900 is not a rocket ship, it can move if needed. Head room, leg room, hip room is bigger then a 5 series, it's more inline with a 7 series, but with a mid level 5 series price tag. The Nappa leather was supple, soft and felt very rich. Fit and Finish was first rate, everything was though of and placed perfectly. IF you are looking for a luxury car not much of a sports sedan then the K900 would be well worth the look. As I stated it is a home run, but not a grand slam...."

I would put the K900 and Equus into the Lexus type vehicle as well as the Genesis and Cedenza. Given how far the Koreans have come and these vehicles are the first of their type, the Koreans studied the play books very well.
Now Luxury is subjective, is the 320i as luxurious as say Ricks Genesis, NO. Is the 320i a luxury sedan compared to a Kia Forte, Yes.
If someone goes from a Mid-level Atlima SV to a 320i they might say the 320i is more luxurious. I don't think you will ever see BMW ever advertise the 320i as a luxury sedan, even with Premium Package, Nav, Xenon lights, I would call it a Entry Level Luxury sedan. Just as you can't call the Genesis or Cedenza a Entry Level Luxury Sedan. Because of their price."

Absolutely my comment to Sweeny answers this.
Kia will have a hard time getting people who own BMW's, Audi's, Lexus and MB to come into their dealership to look at the K900, the perception would be, the K900 isn't to the level of the Germans, but if one looks deep enough they will find out that they are. it would hard for a MB owner to see themselves driving a Kia.
I think Kia and Hyundia have a big uphill battle to deal with, it might have been for them to take a play out of Honda, Toyota and Nissan and make a luxury Brand outside of Kia and Hyundia. Mazda was going to have Amati as their luxury brand and didn't go through with it, I think this is why you wont see a 50-60K Mazda, Getting people to spend that kind of money for Mazada will be tough, very tough."

And they are making it hard of themselves by selling cars like Optima, Forte from the same dealership as K900. When people go to a Lexus, BMW, Mercedes or Audi dealership, they except to see only luxury. That's not the case with Kia. I don't think any amount of marketing can change that perception, when you can see cheap Kia cars at the dealership or on the roads.
I just checked their website and they are advertising - ""KIA named best VALUE brand for 2014"" - not sure that's the thing luxury car buyers are looking for."

1354,justg0,June 2014,"For some of the top companies in the world, their brand is basically the most important thing. For e.g., when a consumer buys an Apple product, they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail, which you will not find in other company products. Take for e.g. Samsung, their main competitor in the cell phone area - even though a Samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people, it just cannot compete with Apple in terms of quality and attention to detail. Samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones. Apple will never do that. The engineers at Apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing, that when you hold their finished product, you can just feel how good it is.
Same holds true for cars, Lexus represents a certain brand, so does Audi and BMW. What brand does Hundai or Kia represent? Even though they may have more features than BMW or Lexus, they just feel cheap, because at their core they are a value brand. And there is no way a Sonata can match BMW in terms of handling or transmission or any of the stuff that makes a car fun to drive. If you care all about HP, then sure there are tons of other cars with that can beat a BMW with similar or lower price tags.
You can't avoid the dealership - you need to go their to buy the car and for regular maintenance. I lease my cars, so I am there at least once every 3 years, plus a few times in between. And you can feel the difference between a luxury car dealership vs. a value brand. I totally understand that I am ultimately paying for that experience and I am fine with it.

1364,markcincinnati,June 2014,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 1)
I’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ELLPS” as a category is “dead” – indeed, I think it is a very much alive and healthy category/segment; it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category. Both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact.
“ELLPS's are like porn, I can’t define them, but I know them when I see them. . .”
We can’t go on unless some stipulations are made, and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion (I would agree if you said opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument). ELLPS autos are difficult to define – perhaps the [unintentionally ironic, I’m sure] quote above, a derivative of Justice Potter Stewart’s famous remark, “I know it [obscenity] when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that,"" captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ELLPS.
I think I’ll just go with something like: An ELLPS is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff”, one that is generally thought to be of higher quality (another “I know it when I see it” attribute, to be sure) with more “available” comfort/convenience/performance features and amenities, higher style/design attributes (ditto) and noticeably more precise fit and finish (tighter tolerances) than other vehicles that the ELLPS candidate can be measured up against. The dealership experience also bears noting too, as it is, or should be, a cut above, too.
The ELLPS is kind of an anomaly (or at least it was), since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance, traits that used to be almost mutually exclusive. Perhaps an ELLPS candidate or incumbent is (or should be) like the tire type we call “Grand Touring”. But, then, even that metaphor falls short these days, as it certainly appears that one of the prices (pun intended) for entry into the 2014 ELLPS class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st century. Maybe, today (for American consumers), the more correct tire metaphor for an ELLPS is “Ultra High-performance All-season”. Of course, we need be mindful of the “S” in ELLPS, which, of course stands for sedan (and I’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4-doors, despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4-door coupé” for instance).
Perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ELLPS would be helpful (as would a level setting question or two): A Bentley (any Bentley) is not an ELLPS (I would argue it is not an LPS either), nor is any Porsche (even a Panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ELLPS and LPS, if you axe me) or a Hyundai. But does this exclude the somewhat stand-alone models named Genesis and Equus?
I think both the Genesis and Equus fall short on their “P” quotients, making them ineligible for either ELLPS or LPS inclusion, but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest Car & Driver review of the Genesis sedan now with “suspension tuning by Lotus”).
Buicks don’t count either, right? But wait, what about the Regal GS with AWD and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ELLPS members from Germany, Japan (and Sweden)? Does said Regal GS merit an invitation into the hallowed ELLPS category or is it yet too soon to bestow this lofty ~yet perhaps increasingly dubious~ honor?"
1365,rbirns1,June 2014,"Watches and cars are not a good analogy. A car is for transportation, but has many facets (comfort, performance, features, etc.) that vary greatly from one to another. A watch has just one function, and all watches pretty much handle that function the same. Other that that it's all for show, literally just a piece of jewelry."
1366,markcincinnati,June 2014,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 2)
Can any sedan, regardless of pedigree, be inducted (or indicted) into the ELLPS hall of fame if it cannot be had with either RWD or AWD (FWD only cars need not apply); likewise can any sedan that is primarily, obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ELLPS or LPS club membership (thinking of the current Lincoln MKZ which screams badge engineered Ford Fusion here)?
Hopefully, too, we can stipulate that to be in the ELLPS, even with all of the MSRP bracket-creep we’ve seen these past few years, that there is a “size component” we should probably consider. For example, even though today’s BMW 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5, we will accept a 3 series (no matter how pricey) as a member of the ELLPS clan in good standing, but we won’t admit any 5 series (even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4-cylinder turbo, and option stripped – than a 3 series) because the 5 series is simply too big (at least at this instant in history; and, let’s agree this could change as the 2’s, 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next).
And for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new A3 – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen A4 – and say, “Nope, you’re not ELLPS, you’re a Premium car.” Personally, I’d exclude the A3 from the club, perhaps calling it an Entry-level ELLPS instead. But, that would be just plain silly.
Yet, for discussion purposes, I’m not sure I want to be engaging in conversations with those who aren’t interested in, ahem, “The right kind, or our kind” [of car] – you know, allowing them in here just might make the conversations even messier and perhaps occasionally, er, ""from time-to-time"", even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already (if that’s even possible).
So we’re left with [my] belief [and maybe yours too] that the American automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market (one that is growing more so all the time). Perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows: Virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ELLPS and LPS class – and granted ELLPS can mean different things for folks in Beijing and Buffalo. The reason for this LPS-Lust is simple: Premium compacts (like the new A3), ELLPS’s (like the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport) and LPS’s like the Mercedes E-class, etc. are where the profit margins soar. No wonder Hyundai (and KIA) are, with each successive generation, pushing hard, harder, hardest to be members of the Acura (for now), Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and possibly Volvo Club.
Why? So they can raise prices, natch.
Remember the Lexus playbook (bring in a car -- and give it a ""number"", not a name: LS400 -- that apparently has 100% of the Mercedes content down-pat and sell it at 75-80% of the price of the Merc)? The only thing that might be the “yes but” for the Korean’s is that they’re trying to become ELLPS and LPS club members without separate, purpose-built dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ELLPS and LPS cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi; yet, the only person I know who has an Equus says the dealership experience has been superlative.
For now, we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really high-end cars (like the Bentley mentioned above or other super-luxury brands from foreign lands). At this point in time, we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by Car & Driver’s recent article “25 Cars Worth Waiting For”.
The ELLPS category is more alive now than at any other time in history. At least that’s the way I see it.
Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."
1367,stickguy,June 2014,"Mark, I disagree about the blanket exclusion of FWD.
And I guess it is clear you require brand snobbery as part of the criteria, as opposed to being based on purely function.
2020 Acura RDX tech SH-AWD, 2023 Maverick hybrid Lariat luxury package."
1368,markcincinnati,June 2014,"I think disagreement regarding FWD is a good thing. I have had many -- or at least ""several"" FWD cars from US and German mfgrs over the years and I found them worthy of many things, perhaps even inclusion into the ELLPS and LPS rank and file.
Funny, sort of, it used to be that 4-cylinder motivated cars need not apply. Well, my my my how things have changed. I'd be (I've been) proud and pleased to have a 4-cylinder BMW or Audi and probably I'd be fine with an ATS with a 4-cylinder motivator too.
Right now, today, at this instant, however, I believe FWD vehicles need not apply -- regardless of how you and I may feel and think about the subject. I think the bias, right now, against FWD is so strong it may be ""stronger than dirt""! Evidence the Genesis ""brand"" -- Genesis eschewed anything but RWD for the first generation, now with the new ones, they're offering up both RWD and AWD in the 6-cylinder version and promised AWD in the 8 ""soon"". FWD, currently and based on much that I read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were ""not quite right"" for some reason. You're working on getting rid of it ASAP, but these things take time.
On the other hand, who knows, the benefits (and there are many) of FWD may win out after all. Just remember that FWD was initially put in cars to make them cheaper (to make and buy). There is, for some, a stigma associated with ""FWD"" cars that aspire to be in the Premium, ELLPS, LPS, High-end luxury or Super luxury class. Same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) RWD or AWD. Mercedes did bring out the CLA as FWD, to be sure -- and there is some risk there (but it can be had with AWD); the A3 is also FWD (like most Audi models) and offers up AWD. At this point ALL incoming inventory for the A3's (here in Cincinnati) will be quattros. That may change.
The ATS and CTS were rendered from the get-go as RWD (with AWD available) because that is what is (NOW, today) expected.
Luxury may or may not = ""Snobbery"". We're talking, here, on this forum, about some variation of a type that contains the words: Luxury, Performance, Sedan -- entry level or not. Luxury is beyond (above? beside? below? -- pick one) being based on ""pure function"", I think is safe to say.
Luxury means to most of us, I assume, ""stuff"", features, amenities, capabilities, levels of refinement beyond what is ""basic"", beyond what is strictly necessary. If you think this equates to brand snobbery, even if I conceded (personally) your point, even if I 100% agreed with you, this is the place where ""we"" are going to discuss, debate, and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars (that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of ""high"" performance).
So yes, brand snobbery is ""a"" criteria for this discussion, just not necessarily ""my"" criteria to be a member of ""the club"". However, I can somewhat sense saying ""If the shoe fits"" isn't an inappropriate thought.
I saw a very long and impressive video about the Chrysler 300C when it first came out -- and the Chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an Audi A8.
I love the 300C, especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and AWD, but Senator, ""I've known A8's and you ain't no Audi A8.""
The point is, we -- here -- are but PART of the market -- and we may disagree with the overall market's standards and definitions (and they keep changing all of the time) -- but we need to recognize, I think, the prevailing trends, ideas and standard-bearers. I'm operating under the assumption that this ELLPS forum is one of the places to be able to discuss certain brands and not have to apologize that they aren't in a more hoi polloi category in a manner of speaking."

Watches and cars are not a good analogy. A car is for transportation, but has many facets (comfort, performance, features, etc.) that vary greatly from one to another. A watch has just one function, and all watches pretty much handle that function the same. Other that that it's all for show, literally just a piece of jewelry.
Both items have a specific, basic function. But, then, as you note, many facets and variations on a theme. Yes, cars offer more variables both by necessity, design and for profit. But, as an analogy, I think it works as you can take the basic function of each and build upon it to meet whatever desires one may have.

1370,markcincinnati,June 2014,"rbirns1 - I disagree with your observations and conclusions regarding watch/car metaphors.
On the other hand I violently agree with your right to your opinion and your right (unless someone here at Edmund's objects) to say it long and loud.
I believe the ""data"" and ""professional opinion"" supporting your conclusions about watches, however, would be difficult, perhaps nearly impossible to come by.
I do believe the same data-deprived statement could actually be made about cars, too -- please note I am NOT being serious here, just ironic or perhaps sarcastic (sometimes difficult to carry off in one of these postings without it inadvertently coming off as a personal criticism, which it is not meant to be):
""A car has just one function, and all cars pretty much handle that function the same.""
I sincerely hope no one here thinks that would even remotely be true.
But I do believe there is plenty of data and opinion to support the notion that [luxury] watches and cars (and even pens, damnit) have many attributes, not just a single one.
The metaphor suggested -- or was meant to suggest -- attributes or characteristics that would help provide ""color commentary"" about luxury or premium products, the marketing of said products and the market for same.

I agree, however, they misprinted some facts. On the 228i, leather is a stand alone option $1450. Audi put a better tire on the A3 in sport package, but the 228i was quicker. Then add $375 for the aftermarket plug and play stage 1 and the other two cars will have to sit on the porch and watch, 0-60 in 4.9 second (stock), that is .7 second slower then the M235i, and I'm guessing with the stage 1 added, the difference between the two would be VERY close..

Although not a scientific sample, I've spoken to 8 people who own the TL (2007 - 2012), TSX (2010 - 2014) and MDX (2014). I had read a lot of people complaining about one issue with their acuras and it seems they have the same problem as the accord - wind noise (that is one of the reasons I bought a Toyota in 2010 instead of another accord - wind noise). Every one of the people I spoke to said they had wind noise from the windows. Is this a fluke or is this representative of what I can expect if I buy an acura?"

I had a 2000 accord and it had tons of wind noise. In 2005, I looked at an accord (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford. In 2010, I test drove a couple accords and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively listen for it) so we bought a Toyota. I have test driven and ridden in a few new accords (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing).

I think this is something that is very subjective though. I have a new style RDX, and notice no wind noise. I also never noticed any on my 2005 Odyssey, 2005 Accord, or 2000 TL (still have that one).
about the only noise is tire noise on certain surfaces, but I never considered that objectionable even on bad pavement.

Sorry Wayne, it post too quickly. I had 3 accords and have a 2012 Genesis. Hondas were great cars but had terrible road noise. I think the most recent Acuras have done a lot to reduce road noise (I do not remember the wind noise in my Accords as the primary source of noise).
The Genesis is a very quiet car and the 2015 Genesis is probably quieter still. But you have to know what you want. The TLX is likely to be sportier than a Genesis. The new Genesis is a full on luxury car with a premium interior and wonderful seats. It handles well but I will bet the TLX will be tidier, if for no other reason than it is will smaller and Honda has a good rep for tidy handling cars. The Genesis It is going to weigh probably 400+ lbs. more than a TLX is you compare the 3.5 TLX to a 3.8 Genesis. It is probably almost a foot longer. I will bet the TLX will handle better, be faster, be pretty quiet and get much better fuel economy (and front wheel drive will be better in bad weather as compared to the RWD Genesis unless you purchase the AWD model which will cost more and have even worse mileage).
It really depends on what you want and what you are willing to spend. Also, as great a car as the new Genesis is, its resale will probably be lower than the TLX because of the perception of Hyundais and the price (probably comparable to the TLX when comparably equipped). This will affect the overall cost of the vehicle whether you buy and hold or lease and dump.
So drive a lot of cars and try to ignore preconceived notions, as hard as that is. I think Acura/Honda is coming back from its worst years and probably still makes excellent cars. Hyundai also makes fine cars today (remember the 1986 Excel?). There is an amazing array of great cars in the TLX/Genesis price range that meet a wide variety of needs.
Good luck with your purchase."

We're in our 50s and retired and I'm not really concerned about the cost or resale.

1401,wayne21,June 2014,"I plan to wait until the 2015s are out (TLX and Maxima) to seriously car shop, but I was out of town today and stopped by an infiniti and an acura dealership to just check out their cars. Not to test drive them, but was interested in the ease of entry/exit (a very important issue for the wife) and the interior appearance. Infiniti Q50 - nice that the passenger seat elevates! I think wife may be able to get in/out without any difficulty. It was a base model and I thought the interior was fine in spite of the vinyl (I would pay the extra for leather). It's been awhile since I looked at an Altima, but I don't think the Q50s interior was any nicer (maybe not even as nice) than the top of the line Altima. I also didn't understand why there was a spare tire taking up such a large portion of a small trunk in a car that has run-flat tires. But I realize the idea behind the Q50 isn't a ""nice interior"". I had read a number of sites that talked about an odor in the Q50 when left in the heat. I looked at one on the showroom floor (not in the heat) and didn't detect anything. It's a car I could own.
Then to the acura dealer just for a look. Looked at the TL with tech package on the floor. I was not impressed. I hope the TLX has a nicer interior. I thought the leather surfaces were nice, but I thought the materials used elsewhere on the interior were pretty cheap - a lot of hard plastic! The passenger seat elevated which was nice to see, but it seemed that in elevating the passenger seat it would be a bit harder to get in and out (harder than the Q50). I think it was the layout of the dash that forced me to move the seat all the way back to get it in that may make it hard for my wife to get in/out. Will wait until seriously shopping and have the wife try it out in the TLX. I am no fan of dealerships adding things to the car and this particular dealership adds about $3,000 to each sticker. I may be off by the individual numbers, but it was $500 for theft marking (if someone steals my car I don't want it back!), $700 to wax the car and spray the interior with scotch guard (I prefer turtle wax ice sealant and my own scotch guard - about $15 for both - and unlike the high school kid working for them that doesn't care about my car, I will do a good job and not miss anything), $750 for wheel locks, mud guards and a rubber mat in the trunk (a mat I wouldn't want in my car) and some other overpriced stuff I wouldn't be interested in and wouldn't pay for. I would pass on the car before paying for any of those things.
If I had to choose between the two, it was a no-brainer. It would be the Q50. I don't think I would even be interested in the TL. But once the TLX and maxima are out I'll seriously shop. Just one person's opinion... the guy that's going to pay for it. Not trying to step on anyone's toes or insult anyone. My wife is most interested in something that not everyone has. We bought a Toyota venza in 2010 and that was one of the reasons for purchasing it (as well as incredibly easy entry/exit for her). The people two doors down from us bought the same green venza. At church, we have 4 green venzas and 1 white venza (ours and the white one are the only 6 cylinders) and 3 of the green venzas (1 of which is ours) park side by side at the church (handicap parking)!"
1402,sweendogy,June 2014,"Wayne21- the dealer add on to sticker in my experience has been on newer well wanted cars- I would doubt the acura dealer would purposely add massive fluff to an acura TL, and if they did you could call bluff pretty easy because fact is acura is not selling many TLs.

1403,markcincinnati,June 2014,"wayne21: I very much enjoyed most of the experience of owning an 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I had added the rear parking sensors and the ""factory"" splash guards to the car and I, to this day, call my TL, my ""Honda S4"" or my ""Acura S4"" -- the car must've come with 3-bent wheels, which may be the reason I thought the brake rotors were warped and had them turned three times (all under warranty).
Once the wheels were replaced (with a 50% credit from Acura), the car was smooth and the brakes didn't chatter or feel warped in any way.
I got the idea to call the TL my ""Acura S4"" not from an original thought, but from an Automobile test report where the S4 and the TL were compared even though the report observed most folks would probably NOT cross shop the two cars (they were some $11,000 apart, too -- the Audi was more expensive, of course).
I got tired of the Acura feeling about 90% of what I had hoped it would be -- which is actually a compliment considering I was comparing it to a car that was about 25% more money.
In any case, my Audi dealer (who is also an Acura dealer, go figure) made me a deal I couldn't refuse once he found out I had ordered a new Lexus IS350AWD F-Sport. Bought out the Acura lease (less than a year to go as I recall) and gave me a discount of 6% off the sticker of a new S4 configured exactly as I wanted it.
At the same time, my wife's Infiniti (2011 FX) was also coming off a 39 month lease and, yes, you guessed it, the Audi dealer (also an Acura dealer) is also an Infiniti dealer and once they got wind of my wife's tap dancing with a new BMW X3, made her an offer on a new Audi SQ5, that she couldn't refuse.
During our shopping adventure, we test drove the daylights out of all the usual (and some unusual) suspects.
I oh so wanted the Q50S/AWD to be the ""it"" car for the 2014 MY. It was good, maybe almost very good -- but for the money that I had to pay for the 2014 S4 I ended up with, I couldn't do it. BTW, probably not gonna make any friends, but I think I'd rather have the Q50/S than the 3 serires BMW we tried.
In any case, I want to be supportive of your pre-decision to go with the new '15 TLX SH-AWD, the Acura's can still make (for me) a pretty good value case, even if they are kind of an ""S4 lite."""
1404,wayne21,June 2014,"Thank you, markcincinnati. I'm looking forward to the TLX coming out. Our neighbor just bought a BMW 330i with sport package. We alternate driving when we go out together and my wife doesn't like the car because it sits too low, rides too rough (rigid) and she thinks the interior is cheap (leatherette). I have owned a number of European cars (two while stationed there and two while living in the US) and I swore I'd never own another (frequent and high maintenance costs). We've been taking a lot of trips and will get serious about buying when we return from our trip to Maine in August. I think we're leaning toward Q50, TLX, maxima or murano, but my wife is likely to throw a curveball and pick something totally different. It is good to get honest feedback (educated) from people who own these cars, though."
1405,tlong,June 2014,"The dilemma seems to be that nothing gives the passion of an Audi or BMW, but then there's the maintenance and repair costs if you keep the car a long time. With Acura you get Honda reliablity and 80-90% of the experience. I had an Audi and loved it but got rid of it sooner than most any other car. I have my Acura at 140K and it's been very reliable but I still miss the Audi..."

1407,wayne21,June 2014,"Maybe it's a 335. IDK. But I do know it's a 2014. They bought it off the showroom floor and it now has 1,200 miles on it after 2 months."
1408,markcincinnati,June 2014,"The words reliable and durable do give my wife and me pause -- but, gulp, we went ahead and bought our first car EVER, the SQ5. I leased the S4, but with the intention of buying it off lease -- we'll see how the word durability holds up to time and miles.
With respect to reliability, however, I would have to say my European cars have not lacked reliability, but the longest I ever kept one was 66,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6), so I am probably not the poster boy to tout European reliability.
My negative reliability experiences all have had to do with American cars -- and mostly Chrysler cars, at that. The thing is, as ""unreliable"" as the American cars proved to be, well, it was pretty close to impossible to KILL one of them -- so I guess I would say I've had unreliable, yet durable cars -- and I thought, at one point, ""why can't I have both?""
Sit down: Then I bought a brand new AMC ""American Eagle"" -- my first AWD car (pre Audi, if you can believe it -- but I am, after all 62 years old). Holy cow, talk about a rolling pile of junk -- if it wasn't welded on, it fell off. The brakes were ""same day"" affairs -- but the thing had a plaid cloth interior and a really cool steering wheel (leather wrapped). And, hey, it WAS AWD (I assume, after all, it was a Jeep with an AMC Concorde body mashed on the frame) and it would go where no one has gone before in all kinds of weather. This was pre-trail rated, but -- idiot that I was -- I took it soft roading and had no fear going at least a little bit off road, too.
Taking it into the dealer was a real treat, too -- something was always needing to be salved with money. I couldn't wait to be able to afford an Audi -- got my first FWD one in 1977 a 1978 5000.
Anyway, I guess I am at a point where I really do expect, nay, demand both reliability and durability -- I get your desire for the same and hence your conclusion to go Acura or Infiniti.
I'll echo, somewhat, the above statement by quoting my wife who I asked ""why not get another Infiniti -- the thing has been trouble free?""
Her reply: ""Infiniti ain't got no soul.""

It didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got it and it didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got rid of it, but it spent plenty of time getting little things fixed. My second assignment to Germany saw me getting a 318i. Great little car until it learned that I'd pay for electronic repairs. It seemed to have a mind of its own and loved to have little things fixed. In the US, I had 2 diesel rabbits (made about 50 miles from my hometown) and perhaps because they were ""diesel"" they provided a license to steal when they went to the shop. Lots of little things that nickel and dimed me to death.
I won't even go into the UAW-built cars I have owned. I will not even consider buying a car built by the UAW. Since going Japanese, I have been most happy. Very reliable! I think I'm going to stick with Japanese. My wife wants to ""step up"" a notch and thus the look at Infiniti and Acura. She says the Avalon is for ""old people"", but I know better than to ask what age she is talking about. She turns 59 next month and I know she wants something before she hits 60.

1411,m6user,June 2014,"In 2007, when looking for a car for my wife to commute in, I was down to a Jetta and the Mazda6. I have a nephew that is a VW tech and not a lightweight tech either. He was recruited from a dealership in Maryland to a huge dealership in a midwest city complete with all moving expenses and and nice up front bonus. I had no idea that auto mechanics had these kinds of opportunities. Anyway, I asked him if it were him which one would he choose and he asked me how long I planned on keeping the car. I told him if we liked the vehicle we usually kept a car for 6-7 years. He told me without a doubt get the Mazda or I would be a frequent visitor to the repair shop after warranty and it wouldn't be cheap. I think with his many years of experience he knew what he was talking about and took his advice. Her car has been absolutely trouble free for 7 years and 109k. Not a dime on repairs, just normal maint. Oh, I take that back.....I've replaced two light bulbs."

Right out of College, I went to work for Sony, I had bought a MB 300SDL (used) as my business car (yeah it was an over kill) and ended up turning into a Demo car for Sony car audio products. I bought the car with 36K miles on and after 10 yrs sold it with 225K miles on it. That car was stone reliable, but it was taken in to the dealer for it's services according to the maintenance book that was provided by MB. Three issues with the car after 100K where covered by MB because of known problems would be the only black eye I had with the car.

Have they outlived their usefullness? Perhaps, particularly given their inability to affect the recent automotive crisis (not sure they could have if they wanted to).
I love BMWs (x3). I love Acuras (x3), too. They're my two favorite brands. BMWs have robust drivetrains with many times sublime suspensions. They can and do cost more to maintain over time (first four years are covered, which means you have to deduct those maintenance fees in your equation). After that, you keep that maintenance up, and they car be reliable over a long period of time. Those charges are more than what I've experienced on an Acura.
Acuras will be reliable, for a long period of time, with little in the way of maintenance (certainly much cheaper than after warranty maintenance on a BMW).
Can't say one is better made than the other. Both have high quality materials.
Both brands are great in my estimation....for different reasons. Choice is good, though.

Well, I also know you're highly hung up on the M235i as well, so I can't say I'm too surprised.
Though, $80K for an M4 seems like quite an awful lot, but it was still more than $10 grand cheaper than the 911.
I think the M235i for, what, $50K seems to give you more bang for the buck.

1429,markcincinnati,June 2014,"Other than the easy answer: Marketing or Money, why can't we upgrade our cars telematics and other electronic items?
I don't know if you know this, but Audis come with a pretty neat technology called ""Audi Connect."" It is provided at no charge for 6 months then it is simply shut off if you don't elect to subscribe to it (at $30 per month or the equivalent of $15 per month for a $450 lump sum payment).
Audi connect through 2014 MY's utilizes T-Mobile as a carrier to provide Internet connectivity and the ability to turn your car into a WiFi hotspot. Using Audi connect and apparently some neat software from Google, many desirable features are offered that are probably worth up to $15 per month on a month-to-month payment plan.
The thing is the carrier is T-Mobile. I can't begin to tell you how poor T-Mobile is -- and when it is at full-strength, it is 3G, very slow and often drops down to 2G, and, well, has very poor signal coverage here in our River City.
Sitting right on the showroom floor, however, is a new Premium+ A3 with 4G LTE AT&T Audi connect. It fires right up, goes about 3 or 4 times faster and is quicker to start-up to boot.
So Audi calls me and wants me to re-up my Audi connect plan -- I do offer $15 per month paid monthly, not $450 in one lump -- IF I can swap out the simm card or the radio itself, for a new carrier -- AT&T would be fine, so would Verizon.
Now I do understand that you may be loving T-Mobile if you're in certain areas of the US. But what may be good in Baltimore sucks in Cincinnati from a phone coverage, speed and drop-out perspective.
I've had Sprint, Verizon and AT&T (currently with AT&T since I got off my BlackBerry -- which was RIMM wasn't it?) The only service I've ever had any issues with is, you guessed it T-Mobile.
You'd think there is a little radio device behind the face of the dashboard that is, after all, a cell-phone. Just like when I got rid of the BlackBerry and went with the iPhone (and changed service providers), there ought to be a way to swap out the tech -- not buy a whole new car for pity's sake.
My friend has a private plane -- the thing must be a million years old, but ""the avionics"" are as current as can be just as the engine and the whole plane are ""overhauled"" annually to keep them ""jus like new"".
It seems to me that the electronic features of these cars hits the showroom floor one generation behind (sometimes more); wouldn't you win friends (and customers) and influence people if you could market your cars as having the ability to be kept current (at least insofar as some ""electronic"" systems are concerned?)
I probably answered my own question, the reason these systems are not ""allowed"" to be updated with new tech has to do with marketing and money not feature and function.
I'd re-up for Audi connect in a heartbeat -- but not with T-Mobile as the service provider; what are you nuts?"

Funny that you would say that.

My wife's FX, on the other hand had the ""all-around-view"" monitor -- now THAT's valuable tech and sadly is only available on BMW's and Audi's of a certain model and/or with a special (high cost) driver assistance package.
I did test drive the X3 with the top view monitor and it was about 90% as good as the Infiniti -- and of course was breathtakingly expensive compared to the Infiniti.
Interesting ""opinion"" from Bob Lutz in the current R&T magazine in response to a question posed to him essentially wondering why German cars are often held up as the zenith of automobiles.
Lutz essentially gave a response that said something like this: ""German cars used to be at the top, and they still may be, but everyone else can do the same thing as the Germans these days.""
I would assume Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche and VW, too, would beg to differ.

However, I still turn my head around to get a wider perspective on what's around. Now, my 2011 335i 2-door does not have a camera but an outstanding proximity sensor system. I find this system more reliable because it audibly warns me of every obstacle on the entire rear side of the vehicle when reversing. Comes in very handy when backing up into my tight garage.
Regarding the German vs. Japanese car comparison, both my Acuras are great vehicles and I will not trade them. However, my BMW gives me a smile each time I accelerate around a turn. The interior ergonomics are ""different"" and takes time to learn but the quality of materials and engineering is first rate. Take for example the windshield wipers. BMW perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business. The rain-sensing wipers have never let me down even during driving in heavy rains at 80-90 mph because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be driven fast. Same goes for my headlights which are bi-level xenon. With my poor eyesight and sensitivity to glare, the BMW is the only car I take out at night because they make absolutely wonderful auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors. Even the seat belt assist (who I lovingly refer to by name) has an intelligence to it and does not extend if there is no one in the passenger seat, the door is not closed, or if the car is in Drive. These are subtleties and design elements that still make, in my opinion, the German cars stand out from Japanese counterparts.

So in other words, it's a smart business move for a marque that has built its success by striving to be ""The Ultimate Driving Machine"" to build overweight numb steering luxo-barges while several of their direct competitors(Audi, Cadillac, Lexus) build better BMWs than Munich. Allow me to quote Peter M. De Lorenzo:

Majority? Make that VAST majority; most new BMW owners think ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for Kansas.
Here's an excerpt from a post I wrote back in March 2012- after attending my BMW dealer's reception for the introduction of the F30:
First Class as usual- valet parking, open bar, all manner of hors d'oeuvres, and a raffle for an iPad3. The new 3er is an attractive piece, but my thoughts were straying to a 2011 135i M Sport over in the Pre-Owned lot.
Pathetic story of the evening: I'm looking at 328i Sport Line and a salesman asks me what I think. I tell him that it's nice, but that it is missing a pedal(the car has a slushbox). A guy standing next to him says ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" I told him that if I can't take the car on the track I'm not buying it- and the guy replies, ""I'd never take my car to the track; especially after I spent three hours washing it."" My son(17 at the time, driving a 1975 2002) laughed about ""The Dork"" for the rest of the evening, but all I could do was silently pray: ""Dear Lord, deliver the BMW marque from all poseurs. Cast them all into the Lake of Fire- or even worse, make them drive an Aveo, Festiva, or Yaris for all Eternity.""

1463,markcincinnati,July 2014,"I am probably wrong in concluding that those of us who write down our opinions and push POST COMMENT here are not exactly the kind of folks who these ELLPS car companies are marketing to. But, then again, I might be right.
The comment somewhere, ""it's missing a pedal"" is one I personally relate to -- but, well that's two of us. Audi, BMW, et al, certainly WANT our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more.
We're lucky -- I think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed DSG unit that Audi uses in several of its cars, I'm as fine as wine with that transmission. Heck, I've even come 'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting.
And, even were I not happy with the 8-speed Audis and BMWs and the 7-speed unit employed by Mercedes, well, I really don't count much anymore.
BMW is selling a lot of cars these days -- up over 12%. The super-majority of these sales, I assume, came with automatic transmissions. Good for BMW. Ditto at Audi and MB -- at least I assume so. It has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since I saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an Audi or BMW dealership. My last stick was an Audi allroad -- 2003 model.
My wife's last stick was a 2005 BMW X3 3.0. Since then we've had a 2005 A6, a 2008 X3, an Infiniti 2011 FX35, a 2009 Audi A4, a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and now a 2014 S4 and SQ5.
In this (the examples of the cars we've owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. Although I would argue that those who buy Audi's S and RS cars and BMW's M's, and Mercedes AMG's no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers' main, or primary customers.
If BMW 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, I would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard Bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board. Ditto the message for Audi and Mercedes -- lose 1, gain 5 (or whatever the number might be).

I want a medium-displacement diesel with a manual transmission. These days, VW is the only show in town, and their reliability (yeah, I know . . . I should be prepared to tolerate ""breathtakingly expensive"") is somewhat suspect.
What I'd like is a BMW 320 or 325 diesel with a manual transmission, since they've not yet discontinued RWD -- they're available in the thousands outside of the CARB-driven North American market. As a second choice, I could deal with an Audi A3 diesel with a manual. Or, I could go piss up a rope.
What I want isn't available, so I continue to tolerate what I can get. I presently drive an Acura TSX from the pre-beak era with a very nice manual transmission that drives the wrong set of wheels. It's been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that I dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time I've driven it (approaching 100K miles), but I've never forgiven Acura for not bringing in the diesel TSX that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that I drive. Guess what -- they couldn't meet CARB.
I drove my first modern diesel in Europe 13 years ago and have been waiting ever since for the opportunity to buy one here. I'm getting older by the day. I don't think it'll ever happen. Thanks, CARB.

It's not the EPA but the buying public. VW sells both manual and DSG transmissions, the DSG transmissions out sell the manual. Yes, this is a FWD, however, the modern day auto is best suited for the oil burner, and with people exceeding the EPA rating in the BMW 328d this wouldn't happen with a manual transmission.

That is not a very accurate analogy; the BMW enthusiasts I know aren't clamoring for the return of carburetors or deletion of ABS systems; I'd even hazard a guess that most could make peace with a decent DCT/DSG as well. What they DO find objectionable is BMW's current penchant for making their cars bigger, heavier, and more insulated from the driving experience. As I've noted before, I've spent considerable seat time in several F10s and F30s and I find my son's 2004 X3 and my Mazdaspeed 3 to be far more involving drives. BMW is coming in second or third in many magazine comparisons, and their novocain-infused steering and poor ride/handling balance are a major reason for their poor showing.

But I don't know for sure because I can't feel what's going on. Its not that the current 3 series isn't a nice car. If I drove one and it was my 1st time ever driving a BMW, I wouldn't lust after it and WANT it like I did when I first drove my friend's 1995 E36 325is (SP - MT).

EPA Passenger Volume = 93.3 cu ft
EPA Cargo Volume = 13.2 cu ft for base and Tech (14.3 cu ft for Advance)
EPA Total Interior Volume = 106.5/107.6 cu ft
Compared to
As far as the Civic comparison, the 2014 Civic has an EPA rated interior volume of 107.1 cu ft total. Of this total, the cargo volume is 12.5 cu ft. **Meaning that the passenger volume for the Civic is 94.6 cu ft. **
Even the Civic is larger inside the passenger cabin than the 2015 TLX by 1.3 cu ft.
It is important to note that the 2014 Accord provides 119 cu ft of interior volume. This is more than 10 cu ft more than the 2015 TLX that only has 107.6 in the Advance model.

I know the wife's current gen Accord is as big as my 4th gen TL SH AWD, even though it's shorter.
I would imagine the same will be true for the upcoming TLX. Probably the way it's packaged with useable space, will be as big or bigger than the current Accord. You really have to look at the entire picture. Packaging efficiency makes a big difference in passenger comfort/room.
My wife really wanted one of the last TSXs. There just weren't many on dealer's lots, and she felt the TL was too big. So, she settled on an Accord (which she does love).

1481,markcincinnati,July 2014,"As nice as the Accord may be, and even including the fact that the Honda is somewhat larger factored in, too, well, the TLX will offer PAWS and SH-AWD. These features put the TLX into another performance category (and the TLX will also offer an 8-speed transmission and a ""sport tuned"" suspension.)
Folks that shop for Acuras do so, I think, because they don't want a Honda (hence Acura's efforts to distance the Acura lineup from Honda products as much as the corporate checkbook will tolerate).
These two cars aren't really competitive [with each other] if you axed me. The new TLX, I would assume will end up being in comparison tests with the Infiniti Q50S AWD and the Lexus IS350 AWD, to name just two.
The Infiniti and the Lexus may have an initial advantage since they are -- ""foundationally"" -- based on RWD chassis. Of course, I wouldn't count out the impact of the PAWS and SH-AWD technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown.
Certainly these cars will want to be included in the same sentences with a BMW 3 and even the somewhat aging A4/S4 family, but I do believe the TLX will work like crazy to position itself as the alternative vehicle (alternative to the Infiniti and Lexus, to be sure).
I'll end where I began, the Acura TLX, perhaps for the first time in years, seems to have distanced itself more from the [Honda] Accord. I'll be so nutz as to suggest these two cars will rarely be cross shopped (other than perhaps the BASE FWD TLX vs the Accord).

Our 18-year-old learned to drive manual only because it was required in order to take dad's car to the prom. A few months later, he was ready to buy his own vehicle to take to college, and we mentioned that since he'd already learned how to drive manual, and seemed to like it, that he should look at manual shift vehicles. Not an ELLPS, but he ended up buying a manual Focus. One of the advantages we sold him on was that he wouldn't likely have to be the bad guy when non-vehicle owning students wanted to borrow his car. Sorry man, I would let you, but it's a manual shift. Still, I was pleased that he learned and wanted to continue to use his skill. When he was in learning phase, we did continually reiterate that it's a skill he'll never be sorry to have mastered.

A little sobering, actually. The 320i has such a weak engine given the price you pay. BMW should just stop selling it and make the 328i the entry level model. (the 0-60 for the Mustang? not listed, but it's 5.7 seconds)"

If the dealer really wants to make a sell, they will do a dealer trade, take MSRP - 7% this is a good start on any 3 series, then subtract the 1K from that. Now since you are previous BMW owner they might give her another 1K off. Is she buying or leasing? Do you know about MSD's?"

Stick, the 320i goes 0-60 in 6.7 sec, faster then a Hyundai Sonata Turbo or Kia Optima Turbo that have 274hp. Stops from 60-0 in 106 feet. Overall I'm happy with the car, and extra boost added has given what the 320i needed. Now for 2015, the 320i will get a power boost, officially BMW has not stated what is it, but talk is between 200-210hp, the 328i is also getting a power boost too.
Now the new M3/4 are nice cars, but are they practical? Some people will say yes and some will say no. But BMW wont have a problem selling every single one. But then again, some people are happy at buying a used car while others don't. The 320 has sold very well for BMW and I'm sure it will continue to do so."

I seriously considered a3 before going for 320i. I didn't feel a3 to be any more faster (though numbers say it supposedly is) even though I think its 220hp. Also a3 lease was lot more expensive, in the range of 328i or more. But the biggest issue for me was I could not get used to the audi awd system.

Her ""wants"" are a bit different than a ""price"" buyer......mineral white, tan leather, nav, xDrive. All that makes a loaded up 320i. And, price wise, you creep into 328i territory. But, she's not a speed demon. I think her salesperson hit it on the head when he said the 320i is the car that BMW wants to sell to hook people on the brand, regardless of what they are coming from. Really good suspension and toss able, as it's much lighter than my previous 335i coupe.
Audi is off the table based on hearing of my experience.
C class was underwhelming....still a $45K car with some equipment added on, that felt ponderous compared to the 320i.
CLA......really good looking car.....but in reality that is the ONLY thing it has going for it.
She was shocked that the Jag (XF?) she looked at had a sticker of close to $60K. Not sure what she paid for her ""S"" type a dozen years ago, but I didn't think it would have been that big of a jump. So, Jag is off the table.

1511,markcincinnati,July 2014,"We live in a little town about 20 miles north of the CBD of Cincinnati. The routes to get from home to the CBD (approximately where my wife and I work), include I-71, looping around from north to south by sort of going east on I-275 and heading down the back road (or so it seems) of Wooster Pike and SR 50.
OK, with that much info at hand, I must say it is virtually impossible to use more than a relatively small fraction of the potential of an S4 or SQ5. I had, for about 5 seconds, thought it would be cool to change out the supercharger pulley and engine management software for more torque and horsepower.
But to what end?
There are so few opportunities where I can push my S4 -- I, so far, literally overtake every other car on any of the above mentioned hi-ways and roads. The ""joy"" of punching it on a freeway entrance ramp is something I would love to do -- unfortunately the acceleration is so quick (sub 50-seconds to 100kph) I overtake everything and end up hitting the brakes hard.
I wouldn't give up the feeling of deep wells of power and torque that these S cars offer -- but I must say, it has become virtually impossible to ""play with"" the power offered in a sane and unselfish manner.
Tuning the Auidi S's or the ""35"" BMW engines would certainly boost their power, torque and therefore increase their ""accelerative"" force and overall thrust -- but I have now reached the point that I see no merit in chipping, changing out the exhaust system, etc, since I can't use (and enjoy) the factory force available.
I assume the same frustrations are ""enjoyed"" by certain Cadillac, Mercede, Volvo, Porsche and other ""sported up"" model owners -- at least if you live in just about any medium to large US city.
You finally get a modern ""hot rod"" and you literally can only tap into a fraction of its capabilities.
Kind of a drag."

1513,markcincinnati,July 2014,"I have been to no less than 8 HPDEs and you are correct roadburner, you can push the cars (however the HPDEs I have attended supplied the cars for us, we weren't allowed to use our own). However, I was thinking more of the ""everyday"" that I ""remember"" from past years.
I'm not suggesting I want to get on a crowded (and ours almost always are) interstate and floor it, consequences be damned. My ""wistful"" intents are more to find a relatively deserted stretch where I can ""punch it"" with the only concern being getting a speeding ticket, not endangering the clog of cars (and their drivers and passengers, of course).
Of our many trips to Germany, some of my fondest memories have to do with taking my BMW, Mercedes or Audi rental on the autobahn and driving from Berlin to Munich where there are some fairly long stretches of the autobahn that have no speed limit.
During those driving moments I had no sense of danger or that our collective high speeds were reckless. Here, as the freeways are ever more crowded and people pass on the right or sit in the far left lane and cruise along below the posted speed limit, driving has become much more like work -- and increasingly risky work at that.
We'll go to an HPDE perhaps once or twice every five years -- always love them, but I guess I'm looking for an American Autobahn -- not gonna happen in my lifetime.
Next up our cars are going to (already are) provide ever more driver aids that take the wheel, accelerator and brake away from us.
Driving and our car culture are changing -- and I am, usually, in favor of the change. This time, however, what I am longing for is my memory restricted return to having fun behind the wheel as we did not that many years ago.
It's the weekend, it's summer -- I'm going to go out and find a curvy ""back road"" (whatever that means anymore) and carve it up.
I'll get over it in a minute.
There, I'm over it."
1514,roadburner,July 2014,"Driving at high speeds in virtually a straight line gets boring after a while. Fortunately my job involves a lot of driving and I often choose to take a nearly deserted rural two lane as opposed to a dull interstate slog, which allows me to enjoy the handling prowess of whichever car I'm driving. The Club Sport requires a bit of finesse and the ability to conserve momentum. You have to make sure it is always in the right gear at the right time(fortunately the pedal placement is ideal for heel/toe downshifts). In contrast, the MS3-fitted with Koni FSDs and Michelin PSS tires-simply bludgeons the road to death; just leave it in third gear, turn in really late with a bit of trailing brake, and nail the throttle once you see daylight(or, as I've said before, visualize obedience training a bipolar pit bull that is mainlining crystal meth).
Think of it this way: if the Club Sport is a Steyr SSG 69, the MS3 is a Colt AR-15 with an extended capacity magazine.

There wasn't much on the road that could beat you in stop light wars, though. It would have to be a very recent muscle car, and the persin driving it would have to know how to launch. Or, AMG, RS, M, etc tuner cars. Aside from that, not much can touch them.
That said, I do think the TL SH AWD, while not as fast in a straight line vs the S4 or 335i (but certainly more than capable), feels more balanced, confidence inspiring and entertaining in its own right. Then, there's the elephant in the room....the significant price difference

I live in the West where it's possible to drive at very high speeds on virtually deserted roads, and I enjoy doing so. I also spend far too much time in commuter traffic, but that can be more pleasant driving the proper vehicle.
That said, the capabilities of most of the ""watch me and what I dirve"" cars are never even approached, unless you live out here, where there's a bit less of the ""watch me"" culture. Certainly more than there used to be (which was zero), but not so much.

A couple of year back we went to the Maldive Island for vacation, we had a 18 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi. When you fly Etihad Airlines in First Class they offer complementary chauffeur service to and from the airport to your hotel, Nice Audi A8L, No problems keeping the inside of the car nice and cool and the car worked flawless for the 45 minute drive, oh and the temp was a cool 102 degrees, and this was at 0035 AM. Our drive back to the airport was 121 degrees.. Our drive back to the airport was in a Lexus LS460L the car just purred for the journey back to the airport."
1541,graphicguy,July 2014,"So, last weekend, by invite, I went to the BMW drive event at my local BMW dealer.
Always a fun event. For those unfamiliar with it, BMW, through the local dealer, allows you to drive their cars, and the competitors' models, back-to-back.
I chose the 435i xDrive, as that is the successor to my beloved former 335ix coupe (E82). Total redesign....interior and exterior. As best as I could tell, the drivetrain is a little ""tamer"" in the 435. But, that could be because I had a performance package on my former coupe. Still, these are Bavarian muscle cars.
The uncommunicative steering was the most noticeable. It's not that the steering wasn't up to the chore of spirited driving. It's that you were never sure if it could do what you asked it to do. You pointed it, and the car followed, but I was never sure it would. Maybe with time and experience, you get used to it. I preferred the steering in my E92.
The other big complaint is that people felt they made the suspension to soft. I don't get that. I think the suspension is a worthy upgrade to the suspension in the E92. It soaks up broken pavement better, even at speed, without unduly upsetting the cabin. Not a huge difference over the E92 mind you. But, a worthy one. I liked it.
The new 4 is definitely bigger than my previous 3. I liked my E92. I like the F32, I think. It definitely has more ""creases"" (my technical term). Headlights are the same with the BMW ""ring"" DRLs. Plenty of room.
My tester did not have the sports seats. Coming from the sports seats in my TL SH AWD (which are some of the best in the biz, IMHO), this was immediately noticeable. Wasn't a fan of them in my E92. Still not a fan of the standard seats in the F32.
Nice dash with color heads up display.....EXCEPT.....the display disappears when wearing sun glasses. Usually BMW thinks these types of things through. This time they failed. Kind of defeats the purpose of a HUD if you can see it only on overcast days.
Whose idea was it to make that auto shifter so convoluted? It's a beer tap looking thingy. In unfortunate BMW fashion, instead of just putting it in ""D"" or ""R"" depending on what you want, you push a button, pull a lever, do this, do that, just to put it in gear. Why make something so simple, so complex?
Stereo was the standard one. I had the HK in my E92. The standard stereo is worse than the HK. The HK wasn't all that great to begin with. Neither is all that good compared to the one in my TL (ELS)....not even close.
The iDrive has evolved. It only took BMW over a decade to get it to a reasonable level of operation and ease of use. But, it's now good. You can write on the top of the little dial between the seats to input a letter. Not so good while driving. A little better when stopped. Not nearly as good as the same Audi technology on the A6 w/Nav. As has been mentioned before, the NAV screen looked like an afterthought.
The ""start/stop"" technology seems a bit smoother than the last one I drive in a 4 cal 328i. Still needs work, though.
Usually I don't sit in the back seat, particularly in a coupe. I tried it out with the 4, though. Entrance and exit weren't bad, given the (slow) electric seats that will move out of the way. But, if you're looking for cost cutting, this is where you'll find it. Back seat was filled with hard plastics that sounded very ""cheap"" when you knocked on them.
All-in-all, still drives like a BMW. Offers good handling, and decent comfort, all while going fast.....very fast. On a tech note, BMW has joined those in the top tier. iDrive is good and offers everything you could want and is relatively easy to use.
If you want the ""snob"" appeal, the BMW muscle car feel, the maintenance and warranty that covers practically everything, and the uber good BMW dealership experience where they take care of everything for you, this is your choice.
At a price, that is. My tester had an MSRP of $57K. For that kind of money (and for a whole lot less), you can find other cars that are just as good, if not better.
Still, I have a soft spot for the 3 series (now the 4). They do a whole lot really, really well. The dealer experience is superlative. I know they are the car to lease vs buy. So, maybe I'm not the person they're targeting.
Drove the competition......C350 4matic coupe. Will do another post for that drive.

1544,graphicguy,July 2014,"Mr Shiftwright.....the Benz C350 4matic wasn't a car I expected to like, but surprisingly did. Probably not a good thing for a BMW comparison drive event. I just went with my sister to help her buy a C300 4Matic sedan.
The coupe felt like a different car. The engine was stronger than the C300. It gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the 335i. But, in the Benz, the 3.5L felt quick, I'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my TL). It was smooth. I think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology. But, compared to the BMW's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have. Just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve.
The C, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the BMW. Granted, the BMW was probably better when driving at 10/10ths. The Benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience.
The Benz was easier to drive fast than the BMW. I'd say that's true of the Benz over my previous S4, too. It's not as fast on an absolute basis. But, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving.
The suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you. It stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement.
Materials.....very nice. The one I drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather. Seats were better than in the BMW, but still not quite as good as in the TL. Same goes for the stereo (H/K, again). Not bad, but not nearly as good as the ELS in the Acura.
All the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a ⅓ step above the BMW. Very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked.
Where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals? How can you use one without engaging the other. They're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity. Somebody at Mercedes needs to lose their job over that design faux pas.
The nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind BMW's iDrive or the Nav/buttons in my Acura. The Mercedes took forever to boot up. Once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks.
Whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the BMW, you found no such items anywhere in the Benz. Everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel.
So, to sum up. The C350 4matic coupe is fast, comfortable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....AND.....
It was $2K-$3K cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix BMW. Icing on the cake....while subjective....I found the Mercedes to look lots better than the BMW, too.
While you may get the premium customer treatment at Mercedes, maintenance is extra cost. From what I understand, a fair amount of extra cost. Perhaps this is one of those cars you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance. Maybe this is one you get to know an indecent mechanic who is fair in what they charge.

I still have a soft spot for BMWs. I'm really interested in the new TLS. But, I won't be in the market for another 2-3 years, so it really doesn't matter right now, at least for me.

2014 model year. Talking with some of my test drive compatriots who were interested in the Mercedes....all mentioned they were torn between the ""deals"" that can be had for a '14 C350 coupe and waiting for the C400, which won't have any deals working in its favor.
Personally? That '14 C350 coupe is mighty sweet. I'd be tempted to get it instead of waiting.
I also learned that the C350 coupe is relatively hard to come by vs the much more common C250. That's kind of like the 428i being much easier to find than the 435i with BMW.

Great write up on the 435i & C350. There are a few things the current (outgoing) C has going for it. Good old hydraulic, belt driven, power steering. An adaptive suspension that reacts to road conditions & steering inputs (electronically). MB is a big company and can throw major incentives in the form of trunk money, cheap financing, & attractive lease rates.
I agree that price is a factor, even when you get north of $50K.

Get this out of the way up front, The TLX looks much better in person than the pics I've seen.
Dealer had two cars....one black with a sweet dark saddle interior. i really like that combo. The other one was white with black interior.
The interiors are a big upgrade over mine, and pretty much turns it into a leader in the segment. All controls move with precision and smoothness that lead the pack.
The 4 has an 8 speed, dual clutch trans. Fun drive. The DCT performs extremely well. Steering is light, and precise. It tightens up well as you gain speed....very linear.
Gun it, and it leaps. Quick, firm shifts with ""blip"" matching revs. It's as roomy inside as my TL. They say it has shorter front and rear overhangs. Maybe. Not sure. Plenty of rear seat room.
Seat of pants tells me 0-60 around 6-6.5 secs.
Leather is good...better than the fake stuff other brands tout. Better than most premium leathers in other premium brands.
Dual screens...top one for NAV. Bottom one for audio and HVAC. This car will compete well with 4 cyl A4s, 320/8i, C300 4 cyl.
The V6 was a FWD Advance. It was as loaded as any car I've ever driven. 9 speed push button trans. It's always in the right gear and will run to redline in every gear. It will snap to any gear firmly....right now!
Great seats, very high quality materials. Super quiet. Again...steering was light but tightened up at speed.
Suspension is really refined and sophisticated...comparable to a much more expensive car. Nothing seems to upset it....and I tried.
I expect 0-60 to be in the low to mid 5s. Like the 4, it loves to run and sounds/feels smooth, typical Acura motors. These just seem to want run hard.
P-AWS is slick....you point.....it goes...no drama, understeer well controlled....as fast as you dare to go.
I saw the MSRP of the V6 Advance.....~$42K. Not sure about the 4 cyl. That includes the ELS surround system (best I've heard in a car), lane keeping, intelligent cruise, sunroof, really nice leather, remote start...everything. A BMW 3 or 4, A/S4, C class would easily cost an extra $10K to $15K for something similar. Dealer said Acura is giving $1,500 discount and $500 in ""add-ons"" for anyone trading an '08 on up.
They had two demos (which I drove). But had sold the 4 they got in stock Last weekend.
This car is going to be a hit. Plus, the headlights are really cool.

1571,benjaminh,August 2014,"Accord EXL Navi vs. Acura TLX Tech
Since I love having built-in navi, this will be a comparison of the Accord EXL Navi ($30,835) with the Acura TLX with Tech Package ($35,025), and so we're looking at a difference of $5k. We all know that to get a good discount on a TLX anything close to what you can get on the Accord you'd need to wait c. 4-6 months for production to ramp up. But I can wait. My 2008 Accord EXL navi 5MT is working quite well, and is still under the HondaCare warranty all the way until Jan. of 2016.
Here's my very subjective evaluation of what each feature of the TLX might be ""worth"" to me personally, compared to an Accord EXL navi. I admit, I haven't yet been in the car, but I do trust Honda/Acura to create a good quality product, since I've owned 3 Accords and had good experiences with all of them....
8-speed dual-clutch transmission compared to CVT: $1000
206 hp engine compared to 185 for the Accord: $600
PAWS precision all-wheel steering: $600
larger performance tires/better alloy wheels: $600
Upgraded brakes (320mm vs. 292mm): $400
440-watt ELS Studio surround 10-speaker: $800
JewelEye LED headlights $300
60/40 split fold down seats: $300
Premium interior including Milano leather: $800
Very nice exterior+structural upgrades: $800
longer warranty: $400
tilt down mirrors: $200
paddle shifters: $300
Real Time Traffic: $200
Rain sensing wipers: $200
Blind Spot Info system: $300
Lane Keeping Assist: $300
Rear Cross Traffic Monitor: $300
Driver's side Knee airbag: $300
Integrated Dynamic System (Econ, Normal, Sport, Sport +): $400
-$600 for LaneWatch which comes with the Accord but not on the Acura.
Some of this stuff I have no idea if I'd like. Lane Keeping Assist? I hope I pay attention and drive for myself (wish everyone would hang-up and drive), but maybe useful....? Rain sensing wipers? Surely I'm not so lazy or blind that I can't turn the wipers on?? So I didn't put much down for those. I imagine an Acura engineer looking at how much time and $ it cost for them to put that in would be annoyed at me.
But a great sound system like the award-winning ELS set-up is worth a lot to me.
Quite possibly I'm still missing some things.
But anyway, admitting that this is very subjective and a total guess (since I haven't yet driven a TLX), but based on the strong reviews, as well as my strong trust in Honda/Acura this upgrade to the TLX seems to be ""worth it"" to me. In fact, it seems to add up to:
c. $8500 or so imaginary dollars of ""worth it"" to me for a c. 5k price.
Seems like Acura is trying to get back in the game by making the TLX a lot of car and a lot of tech for the money.

Bradd....I'm not going anywhere.....
FN.....Until I was with my sister, test driving 320i/8i, I didn't see the appeal of the 320i. Driving one, if your priority is not stop light wars, but a well made, good handling car, the 320i offers all those attributes. Gotta say, you get a car that if you're careful with the options list, for mid-high $30s, that you don't have to worry about, at all, for anything, for 4 years, that's appealing.
Lots of reviews coming in for the TLS. Seems as if the press cars have some sort of glitch where there's some hesitation coming off the line when you first hit the gas. I didn't experience that. Both the 4 and 6 cvl pulled strongly at throttle tip in. I estimate 0-60 in the low 5 sec range, add a second to that for the 4 cyl.
Are they the fastest? No. But, they will be competitive to an ATS or CTS, A4, A6 (4 cyl), Infiniti Q (pick one), Lexus IS/ES. Unless you go to a blown V6 (like in the S4/A6) or turbo'd BMW motors (at much higher cost), you'll be right in line with the field. And, you'll have to climb the price ladder quite a bit to really get significantly better performance.
But, the suspension is where the car really shines. It feels as sophisticated as anything I've ever driven. It trumps BMW and BMW's own game. Ride/handling is superb.
Acuras are notorious for holding great resale. I can see this trend continuing. It is now back on top the tech heap, too. Good looking interior with high quality build and materials.
In short, it feels much more expensive than it is.
Can you tell I like the new TLS?

If you live in the NE and want a RWD car you can get them, might take you a little longer to do it. It's been interesting reading on BIMMERfest that people have bought RWD cars in the snow belt and have no issues getting around in the snow. So is it really necessary to have AWD cars?"

1588,justg0,August 2014,"Acura's model is giving options standard that BMW and Audi charge for, and for a much lower price. I purchased the revamped MDX that came out in 2007 - think it was the 1st one Acura had introduced with sh-awd. Paid under50K for fully loaded. Similarly equipped BMW and Audi were north of 65K. There were quite a few car magazine reviews that had put that MDX best in terms of handling over X5 due to sh-awd. Not that was my priority, but it made the decision easier. I still have it and it is going strong with nothing more than regular scheduled maintenance.
That said, it still does not compare to driving a RWD BMW for me. I will have to drive a TLX to compare to the 320i that I just got.
Here's another review of TLX - http://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2015-acura-tlx-review/, recommending to get the four cylinder over v6. They say: if the V6 model is Tim Duncan, the four-cylinder is Chris Paul."

BMW has gotten a bad rap on the suspension/handling of the F30 and F10 cars but there is a easy fix to this, order the Dynamic Handling Package (DHP in BMW language) cost $1,400. BMW in the past had been criticized on how ""harsh"" it's ride was, so for the F30 they went a little softer (more on this) however, DHP allows BMW to have the best of both worlds, creating a softer ride and keeping the sporting handling. Graphic I'm surprised that the 4 series you drove did not have this. The only F30 not to get DHP is the 320, but this will change, the sales of 320i have exceeded BMW sale projection and for 2015 new options and color choices will be available to it.
My BMW dealer will be hosting their Ultimate Driving Experience here in the next week, I have reserved 3 cars, M235i, 428 Grand Coupe and 5 series Activehybrid.
Now regarding the F30 and it's soft ride, in our house we have a unique chance of driving two cars from two different mind sets. Ricks Genesis and my 320i. I think Rick has enough seat time in both cars to see first hand the difference between them. Latley, I would say the last 3 months Rick has been driving my car a little more and he is picking me up at the airport in it, he tells me the ride in my 320 had a better feel, a more ""planted"" feel on the road and the ride is more controlled then his Genesis also Rick says the steering has better feel."

We live in the same ""neck 'o the woods"". I can't remember the last time I bought a snow tire.
If it's so bad out that I feel my RWD, AWD, FWD car can't make it with the shoes it has, then I don't want or need to be out in the weather. That sort of weather only happens once every 2-3 years around here, though.
Come to think of it, I've driven in worse weather with bald, skinny tires when I was younger and much less intelligent.
I had a really nice Datsun 240Z (bought used) and an MGB GT (bought very used) at one point. Used to drive those in the snow and muck. Not sure I'd attempt that today. But, that was done when I had more nerves than brains.

Then, of course, I traded the TL for the Jag XK. A natural progression, happens all the time. OEM Dunlop Summer tires made even saying the word ""snow"" out loud a dangerous thing! First 1/8"" snowfall and I couldn't get up my mildly steep driveway. Luckily, SUV in the garage to the rescue...

My reference of Bimmerfest was just a sample, and I never stated other wise. But modern cars today that are RWD have the elec nannies to make them drive-able in the snow with the correct tires.

But, they had summer only rubber. Put something half way descent M&S tires and they would go.
Tire technology has indeed advanced in the last half dozen years. I know the first time I encountered run flats were in a 330i (RWD). No problems in the snow, but they made the car ride like a brick. Those run flats are better these days.
Even the all season tires on my son's Fiesta and the wife's Accord are better than the ones I've encountered just 5 years ago.
As you state, with the computers and sensors in today's cars, things have to be pretty severe to get stuck or go flying into the weeds (barring shear stupidity while driving) in the snow.
Even rental cars can get around with their ""base model"" tires. Spent a lot of time from Logan Airport to Lynn, Marlborough, Acton, Waltham, etc.....summer, winter, didn't matter. Coming in and out of the ""Big Dig"" was a challenge. Never got stuck. Never got sideways. Always in a rental car.

Traction control and other electronic nannies as you call them would seem to further lessen the use snow tires to some degree. The nannies and very good quality all-season tires have led to smaller and smaller percentage of snow tire users IMO.
I think there are small regions in the N.E. where topography and winter snowfall probably lends to a much higher percentage of snow tire use than most areas. Anywhere where mountains and lots of snowfall cross paths would make them popular. But in probably 80% of the country they see very little use."

I wouldn’t want you to think that I take advantage of my Audi dealer’s willingness to throw me the keys to a new A3, A6, A7, Q5, Q7, S4, SQ5, S6 or TT (who me?!) – I’ve not really been interested in driving an A8 and the S8’s and R8’s are almost always “sold cars,” besides since my dealer knows when either my wife or I am “in the market,” I’d hate to push it by putting them in the position of having to say “no” especially since we’ve only had our 2014 “S” Audis for months, not years.
It was with the full understanding that we are not currently in the market that my wife and I decided that Saturday last was the day we would test drive a new Audi. We thought long and hard about taking a test drive of either a 2014 A6 3.0T or a 2015 A6 2.0T with the sport package and lots of options. Both of these cars were on the lot and not “sold” cars. My wife asked me what I really, really wanted to drive, now, if I could only drive one car, I immediately answered a new “S6” – that was easy.
A few minutes after walking in the showroom door, we were handed the keys to a 2014 S6 with about 300 miles on the OD and with a few choice options: cold weather package, black wood and aluminum trim, black interior and panther black exterior. Also present: 20” wheel upgrade (from the standard 19” inchers). Since the designation of the S6’s is now Prestige, there were very few features the car didn’t have – it did not have the top view camera for example, or the automatic cruise control including stop and go, etc.
To my eye, I sat down, behind the wheel of The Batmobile (the color combo having a lot to do with that) and pressed the start button only to be immediately more than a little impressed by the “awakening.” Unfortunately, this car was an S6, not an S5, RS5 or even S4. I say unfortunately because the car was clearly focused 90% on the luxury side of sport-luxury. This became even more evident when I put the car into drive (which means “S” or sport mode since I had set the steering and air suspension to Dynamic (along with the engine and transmission) using Audi-Drive-Select. I ultimately changed the steering to Auto mode which gives the car super easy turns at slow speed, but tightens things up considerably as the MPHs climb.
Speaking of climbing, I got onto a nearby Interstate (I-275 by-pass, eastbound) and was cruising along at a steady 60MPH – when all of a sudden, I floored the S6 and counted to three (one, two, three) – I counted pretty quickly too -- certainly 1, 2, 3! (think Sia) -- in less than three seconds. I released the accelerator completely and looked down at the speedometer only to see an indicated 102MPH. The sensation I had was, well, muted, subdued, suppressed – sublime. There was virtually no drama, barely any sound (angry engine or otherwise) lingered at all, and I was coasting down but still showing an indicated 90+-something on the speedo.
What did I do next? Well, I “punched” the accelerator pedal for another Sia-like one-two-three moment, signaled right for the rapidly rushing at me exit ramp, hit the ramp at incredible speed, barely “mashed” the brake pedal only to get a momentary sensation that the S6 had impossibly instantaneously scrubbed off about 80 miles per hour (and almost magically seemed to be going backwards the descent was that swift) as I damn near just coasted to a stop as if nothing had happened 1-second ago. Meanwhile, I awaited the traffic-light to glow green.
I tried out the S6’s handling envelope using my completely accurate and totally made up (therefore unscientific) routine of driving faster and faster and faster in a circle, then carving through an imaginary slalom barely nicking those [also imaginary] orange cones. The thing carves like a hot knife through buttah! A little, not much, body roll – but hey, this thing is a full-sized vehicle, remember.
Here’s the thing, after my test drive – during which time I became thoroughly smitten – I drove (in sequence) our 2014 SQ5 and next up our 2014 S4. Now, I read the mfgr’s published 0-60 numbers for all three of these “S” vehicles, and the S6 is, after all, the quickest of the three, on-paper. The thing is my $58,000 S4 is very quiet, too, and I have the upgraded seats (which certainly seem very similar to the S6’s) further blurring the differences -- between the S4 and S6. My B&O sound system edges out the S6’s Bose system by a small but discernable difference, especially in the clarity department – the B&O tweeters are really impressive, the Bose’s less so.
The S6 however, commands, no, demands your attention – much more so than the Ibis White S4, which seems to have a bit less “presence” than the Panther Black S6.
Regarding the S6: I want one, I want one, I want one – and for perhaps $68-$70,000 (as equipped), I would actually say the value is really there. The thing is, however, the bottom line on the sticker was $79,500+. It (the S6) just didn’t seem to be THAT much more car, even though it would be worth considering hocking the family jewels and taking out a second mortgage.
I loved the S6, I mean I really loved the car – it just isn’t worth (to me), as far as I can tell, $22,000 more than my S4 or $19,000 more than my wife’s SQ5. With an emphasis on more performance, I would possibly see where the money went – however, the emphasis is on luxury, isolation and stealth.
Where the S4 is an iron fist with a velvet glove on it, the S6 is an iron fist wrapped in thick density foam with a velvet glove on it. I guess for nearly 80 grand, folks might well prefer stealth to show-off. I think I get that.
Me? Well let’s just say, I’d like a bit more sturm und drang."

1636,markcincinnati,August 2014,"The new Car & Driver tests the almost here S3 (and at its price point, it ought to be in the ELLPS family). The article opens and closes suggesting that the S3 will cannibalize sales from the S4.
After reading the review, I would mostly agree -- but, as the S6 is to the S4 (that is to say way more luxurious but with plenty of go and stop talent), I would think the next S4 we will get will distance itself from the S3 by virtue of great gobs of power (instead of 333HP, how about 395 -- 100 more than the S3 as a nice round number?) and even more luxury bits and pieces.
I mean the new S4 has to have (or be) a step up either in performance or luxury or both -- and Audi probably will go with a decent power upgrade over the current S4, but likely will go with a huge dollop of lux given the brand's positioning. Perhaps if there is an RS4, there will be great gobs of new power and large lumps of added luxury.
I mean, really, other than the satisfaction of knowing you're in an S4 (and paid more), C&D is right, for most folks the S3 will be the one to asipire to.
My gawd, the S3 can be had for the price of an A4 -- and only loose a bit of trunk space and rear leg room. Most folks here will drive the car solo or have but one front-seat adult passenger.
The only thing lacking from the new S3 is the torque vectoring rear diff. Wouldn't surprise me if they figured out how to do that within a model year or so.
One last thing, a prediction: Given my recent S6 test drive: the new S6, whenever that comes out, will loose 2 more pistons, but manage to have more power and get better mileage and with it being a V6, the car will be less nose heavy, improving its handling performance."

Mark, have you sat in a A3 yet? From what I have read the rear seat are pretty cramp for adults like they were for the first gen A4. I thought the A3 was a way to get people into the Audi fold be offering a lower entry point. BMW decided to offer the 320 to do the same thing, which has been very successful for them since the 3 series sales are up 7% over last year."

1641,markcincinnati,August 2014,"My point regarding the new A3/S3 (which I have not driven, but have sat in) is that it will ""force"" the A4/S4 to move upscale in terms of luxury and it will also get more power so that the S3 will not be quicker than an S4.
The basis for my comments is the new C&D article where C&D says the S3 makes the S4 irrelevant or something akin to that.
I have not seen the S3 yet -- but the A3 would probably receive the same comments -- this time aimed at the A4 -- from the author of the C&D piece on the S3.
If you accept that as having some truth to it, it would seem that Audi will be forced to do something to keep the A3/S3 from siphoning off customers from the A4/S4.
Many folks buy/lease these cars and only the front seats see much adult duty -- the rear seats may be used by an adult, but probably only rarely. I think the A4/S4 is a bit cramped in the back seat -- so the A3, of course, must be quite cramped.
But, who cares if 95% of the time it is a driver and maybe a front seat passenger. Even those who take their colleagues to lunch probably would find no issue with the A3 for the often short drive from the office to the lunch wagon.
What could the A4/S4 do -- add performance and/or add luxury -- and being that you're Audi, you would probably err on the side of adding lux first, performance second (my point about the S6 is that it is a far more ""muted"" sporting vehicle, emphasizing luxury first -- even though it IS a screamer performance wise.)
The 2016 A4 line will -- if history repeats -- not offer up an S4, rather that will come in MY 2017. But, even the A4 vs the A3 will have the A4 needing to be different enough from the A3 to justify the price. Size of the wheelbase, length, width, etc, alone is (and I'm with C&D here) will not be enough to make the choice clear between the two -- the A4 will have to lead with more ""stuff"" more lux stuff and more performance than the A3 at any one point in time.
Perhaps, the 2015 S4 will be more heavily discounted due to the birth of the S3 in the US next month -- get 'em while their hot for about a year.
I may be wrong throwing my lot in with C&D, but I just can't see what the A4/S4 development team has as an alternative to the A3/S3 but to take the A4/S4 upstream, so to speak.
Please make your argument to the contrary, I would really love to think the A4 family can and will hold its own, will be differentiated sufficiently from the A3 to keep the A4 sales on an upward trajectory.
I just don't see any alternative for the A4 but to head for the top (of course this will likely mean a stupid price delta will ""erupt"" between the cars -- something like I was lamenting regarding the price difference between an S4 and an S6.)"

Why does the A4 have to have more ""luxury"" to differentiated itself from the A3? Also how can Audi make it more Luxury? The A3 is about the same size as the first gen A4, so if the A3 is too small for some, the current A4 is bigger and roomier which would fit most people. One can get the same 2L turbo engine in the A3 as in the A4, I think the A4 should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp range and keep the A3 at the current HP rating. Now for the S4, 333hp is not enough to make it faster then the S3 Audi can either increase HP or not worry about it. Again, people who want a bigger car then S3 will move up to a S4, I'm sure there are some items that can not be had on the S3 that you can get with the S4."

I agree and I'm 6' also, granted I think the A3 is more for people who want a premium brand without paying the premium price, since a mid level A3 is around 32K which is rougly the medium cost of a new car today."

1646,markcincinnati,August 2014,"Even without the ""3"" Audi would be/will be hard pressed NOT to increase the content of the A4/S4 (either optionally or as standard equipment). Sitting in the back seat of an A3 is not something I would want to do, granted -- but I'd rather not have to sit in the back seat of a current A4 either.
Now, then, that comment might suggest Audi will enlarge the A4 -- I guess there would be a temptation to do that; there is an A4L in China (at least) to be sure.
Making the A4/S4 more luxury, high-tech contented is, I think (I have no secret or insider info) virtually inevitable -- if not for the competition from the A3/S3, just the competition from the market itself."
1647,sweendogy,August 2014,"@markcincinnati‌ - agree a4 should/will move up as it seems the new C class has done as the new Cla has arrived - audi now has a smaller sedan- a4 moves up- bmw I'm guessing will have a new 1 class at some point and move up the 3.

I thought the Gran Coupe is a sedan, not a hatch. There is the 3-series GT, which is a hatch, and the new X4, which is a CUV-thingy with a hatch.

New poster here. I am considering a 2014 Audi s4 with 1200 miles. Auto tran, sport differential, 19 inch wheels, navi and B&O stereo. To those who have driven or owned this:
1. Is the ride acceptable over non-smooth roads?
2. Reliability?
3. MPG?
I really liked the feel of the car and the smooth power from the supercharged V-6 during the test drive.
Basically, how do you enjoy owning and driving the car, and how livable is it. Also, how has Audi been to deal with? I have previously owned BMW 335i and 128i with sport packages. Enjoyed them both. How woul you compare the S4?

It is a different car, newer development derived from the sedan, but took its own life. BMW heard complaints on the new three's steering when it came out, so they reportedly made some efforts to improve it. Now, it is possible four's those settings will filter back to the original soon.

1667,graphicguy,August 2014,"OK....for no other reason than I'm interested in a lot of diffrent cars, and I MAY BE in the market in the next 24 months, AND I was in close proximity to both a Lexus and an Infiniti dealer last night after work, I did some test driving.
This is hot on the heals of doing the BMW drive event. I like BMWs. I wanted to drive the M235i, but they didn't have any to test drive....only 4 series.
435i xDrive, with sport pack? Yep....I'll take two. Problem is, I think BMW has now started to believe their own marketing hype. And, they've priced themselves accordingly. Not sure you get anything more than what I got from my former E92.... less, actually. But, there's been a definite rise in price while staying the same or getting worse in some areas (steering being the most obvious). High $50s? Low $60s? Sorry I'll drop out of that market. Some will walk into their local BMW store with $60K burning a hole in their pocket for a 3/4 series not knowing what else they could get for that kind of money. I'm sure they aren't going to miss me, though. They're doing fine without me.
Infiniti Q50.......drove an AWD version with sport wheels and supposedly sport suspension. It was either too soft, wandering, needing constant minute corrections to stay straight, or doing the same thing, with much higher effort involved. Electronics feels like a cold Windows 3.1 boot up. $50K? I'll take the highly discounted G37x Sport for $10K+ less.
Not bad looking, mind you. Just not my cup of tea (yet again).
Lexus....IS350 F Sport. Tried to buy one when they first came out. Dealer didn't want to deal, so no dice. Now, they're ready to deal I see why the trade rags have rated this car higher than the 3 series. The grill is a love it-hate it affair. I'm used to that (with my TL), though. Drive it as fast as you want, however you want, wherever you want. Very nicely weighted steering. Really fine handling/ride feel. As is typical for Lexus, very good materials and build quialty.
The one I drove was $49K, pretty loaded up with Nav, leather, sunroof, etc. Probably the prettiest grey paint job I've seen on any car (Nebula Grey). Out of the shoot, sales manager (who introduced himself after the test drive was over), said the IS I drove would be in the $47K range (maybe get serious in the $45K-$46K range?). If/when I get ready to buy, I'll come back to give them a shot at my business. Once again, the 3/4 Series are nice cars. The IS350 is better, for significantly less money.
I informed all the dealers I was not in the market. This is the difference between high end dealerships and the ones that know at some point they want you back into their store. They'll acknowledge you're ""just looking"" and offer to be there when you're ready.
This, tied to what I've seen from Benz and Acura recently, not a bad time to be shopping for an ELLPS.

1670,sweendogy,August 2014,"2015-A6 3.0 supercharged test drive.

Prem pack, Bose, nav - non sport - 18 all seasons.

Got a service done on my s4 yday/today and left with a 15 a6 with 32 miles on the car as a loner. First off audi interiors are amazing and this a6 was extra cushie compared to my s4 with summer slicks. Nice highway cruiser - but a bit of a boat in the turns. Pickup from the 3.0 smooth but not dramatic even in dynamic mode. Infact it made me wonder how slow or unsporty the 2.0 would be- as the car is huge. I drove the car for approx 20 miles - and have to say if I was maybe 10-15 years older it would be my cup of tee but not at this juncture.

Other observations - sat in an A3, while the doors seemed a little tinnie the overall car was pretty impressive and I would certainly take a look at this car if considering. The layout is simple and it seems like a great commuter car in 2.0 form. The trunk also huge for a compact.

S6 - saw one in blacked out (optic pack?) form - so attractive.

Glad to have the s4 back- small puncture fixed in rear tire."
1671,jbeck5,August 2014,sweendogy - How have you liked your S4? Is it as good as a day to day commuter as it is as a sports car?
1672,sweendogy,August 2014,@jbeck5 - is it Joel? The s4 for me has been a good commuter in traffic over 4k miles. I drive a total of 20 miles each day- decent on gas in traffic I'm getting 18-19 in city- when I'm able to drive traffic free I can get 27 - I've seen 30 once. I do flog it time to time so I'm guessing I could prob do a little better. Great stereo - seats are nice and firm- wish they were full leather (prob the only thing I would change) - car rides on rails and even with its girth can get around the twists with little drama(sport diff def works).

I guess this is a situation where you either get lucky with an S4, or you don't. I didn't. Quattro system would 'bind"". Audi said they could fix it,but couldn't. Had some other gremlins. Was annoyed by the Audi rep and how they handled my situation. Audi ended up buying it back.
MPG was 18-19 MPG in town...mid 20s on the interstate. I kept my foot in it most of the time, though.

Happens with all brands, over on Bimmerfest a guy bought a new 535d and his complaint was it pulled to the right, after being at the BMW dealer 4 times they found nothing wrong with it.

Someone on BF gave the guy a contact person at BMW NA he sent the video's with all documents from the area rep and dealer. 3 days later he got a phone call from BMW NA and instructed to bring the car to his dealer, where BMW bought his car and he got another one.

However, since they bought it back, I've read a couple of trade rags who mentioned how their test Audis with Quattro would bind. Towards the end of my ownership of the S4, it felt like one of the wheels was locked up whenever I went around a corner.
My BMW dealer was always helpful, as my Acura dealer is, too. That has a lot to do with them being my two favorite car brands.

Didn't say it was right. It's just the way it is. The rep has a job to do and his performance is measured by goals set by the company. If he simply bought back every car that people felt was a lemon, he'd be out of a job very quickly. Besides, his customer is the dealer not the consumer.

Robr2....yes, all true. Bought it outside the servicing dealers' territory.
Bought in Chicago....serviced in Cincinnati. I saved $4K on the car by doing that. Plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how Audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an Audi dealer in the country.
I've bought enough cars to understand what happened. You're probably right. There was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given Audi has a Central Region based out of Chicago...not sure if OH is included in that).
However, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. They acknowledged there was a problem. They said Audi had a fix. They never did, or if they did, it didn't work. The local dealerships (Audi recommended I try both) diagnosed it the same way. Both said it was a problem. No one could or would fix it. There were other issues with the car, however....not just the Quattro binding.
At one point, the Audi Customer Service Rep even said that I was having it serviced at a dealer that I didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue. I've always thought that, but that's the first time I heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it. That said, I would imagine this does happen. There has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this.
So, you go to Audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their cars, as long as you buy them. But, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed. That must have been in their fine print somewhere that I missed.
Don't get me wrong. Not taking it out on you, Robr2. You've brought up a lot of bad feelings I had with the brand, their dealerships, etc from when they'd rather fight with me than focus their energies on fixing my S4. They had an opportunity to keep/save a customer. They made a concious decision to act like jerks instead.

I bought a certified honda in another state after finding a great deal, clean car fox and all. After 250 miles it started leaking fluids, I opened the hood and found a piece of lower bumper lodged in the engine well- along with a poorly done overspray underneath some plastic bits. At 3 weeks of ownership I took it to my local dealer which is 200 miles from where I bought it. They confirmed my worse fears that the car was in a major frontal and should never has been given the honda certified status- Honda was no help said but would investigate, I could not have my family in this car and promptly drove the 200 miles- with documentation from the other dealer- a detailed letter from my lawyer with threat to sue- my detailed expenses incurred -homework done on new model, honda reference numbers on said case and best of all my cop buddy friend (to restrain me) . After 2 hours and almost a black eye I walked out my total cost for used car including 1k for said expenses- I also was given a heavily discounted new car which we have had now for 3 years and runs like a top.

Not a lawyer or even an expert, but I'll disagree. It's just a used car. The only thing Honda has to do with it, is the extended warranty. Which,if they find out it doesn't qualify for, may rescind and refund the dealer.
They may pressure the dealer to make it right for the customer, but I doubt they have any legal obligations. (Which is probably what you just said..lol)

Car: 2015 S3, black on black, base suspension & 18” wheels / tires.
The TQ is everpresent and always available – offering instant thrust any time, even in higher gears. One of my top ‘requirements’. [ I am a Torque Addict. ] The 2.0L 4 cylinder [ highly boosted ] engine feels and sounds much smoother than the [ not nearly as highly boosted ] 2.0L in my 2013 GTI. Sounds, and feels and pulls ‘expensive’. Pulled cleanly and smoothly from low RPM and sounded eager to run all the way to the red line. I believe the C+D 12.9 sec. quarter mile result.
[ Horsepower 292 @ 5,400–6,200 rpm
Torque 280 lb-ft @ 1,900–5,300 rpm ]
The 6 speed DCT is very responsive and the shifts, both up and down are accomplished very quickly and with no interruption in power flow. RPM match on downshifts is flawless. The paddles are active at all times, another of my requirements.
I spent several minutes looking over the interior, while my sales contact was on a call. Everything = switchgear, surfaces, displays, etc. looked and felt of appropriately high quality. The seats were immediately comfortable and felt very supportive. They have the adjustable thigh support that I like. The front center armrest is adjustable up / down & fore / aft. A nice touch that I appreciate.
The handling, on several deserted curves, was quite confidence inspiring. No feel of front heavy weight distribution. The steering works well, for me. I was pleasantly surprised by the ride, given that this did not have the Audi Mag Ride, nor the 19” wheels & tires than are required with that option. It handled the occasionally broken and deteriorating sections of asphalt and concrete pavement I encountered very well, indeed. This could save me $1,500!
Overall, I was very impressed – and [ pending a longer test drive ] this has been added to my ‘short list’ of possible next car to purchase or lease. That list includes the BMW M235i.
One minor complaint – the interior rear view mirror is oddly small & oval shaped?

I was thumbing through the June 2013 copy of the British magazine CAR and it contained a very positive review of the new S3. That review was followed by a comparison of the S3 to the Mk7 GTI with the Performance Pack(an extra 10 hp, better brakes, and an electronically controlled mechanical limited slip diff). The same guy(Ben Pulman) wrote both articles and he concluded that aside from the S3 being @1.5 seconds quicker in the 0-62 mph sprint, the GTI was essentially the equal of the S3 in all but the worst road conditions. Given the price differential, he would ""...take the GTI every time.""
In my case, it's rather academic, as I already have a FWD hot hatch with a true limited slip for semi-pro levels of hooning and I'm not at all interested in an AWD track toy, but I still found the articles to be illuminating.

1720,markcincinnati,August 2014,"Just had the 15,000 mile service on my '14 S4 S-Tronic. While in, I also had the tires rotated and was comp'd a set of $69 wiper-blades, causing the computer to spit out the admonition that these freebies were a one-time deal. The service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger.
I had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since I replace them every 15K as a matter of routine.
Typical to the Audi powerplants, I am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power. The engine that keeps on giving now even shows 30 or more MPG's from time-to-time, beating my 2009 2.0T A4 (which had the 6-speed Tiptronic.)
After driving the S6 recently, I am still smitten -- were $'s no object. But, if you're considering a $55K+ ELLPS, you owe it to yourself to drive one of these -- other's may come close, but -- for the money -- this is THE one to beat. Of course this is certified, 100% bias-free fact based commentary.
Couple of program notes if you get serious about a 2015 S4:
If leasing go Premium+
If buying at least consider Prestige
Get the full-leather seating
Get the B&O sound-system
Get MMI Plus
Get Audi-side assist
Consider Audi-sport differential if you ever like to really carve into curves
Debate the merits of sticking with the 18"" wheels -- even they come with 40Series tires -- ride improves, tires cost less, last longer -- and if you axe me, the OEM tires aren't the best anyway, so you'll want to consider replacing them. Of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty.
The trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide.
Paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am I saying) get one of the free colors.
The video reviews and Motor Trend says 0-60 4.4 sec. The S3 may equal it, but there are several reviews all over the web that claim the S4 is quciker than Audis published claims.
The Audi Connect is 3G -- it sucks (if it is T-Mobile) -- great concept, crappy execution.
Objectively this is the best you can get, if you don't want to spend more.
If you want something for less $ that will satisfy your needs for speeds, etc, consider the Acura TLX V6 w/SH-AWD and in Advance trim -- consider it a bargain S4, sort of.

1727,markcincinnati,August 2014,"Personal Preference Speaking Here:
I do I do I do really like the A6 family (espcially the S6) -- the current A6 is, IMNSHO, a looker from the outside and MOSTLY on the inside.
A few years ago, pre-widespread implementation of nav systems in the LPS and ELLPS classes, Pioneer electronics offered a replacement head-unit for many cars, Audi being among them.
The thing looked pretty standard, seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car (this was back in the days when Audi cars came with Blaupunkt head-unit systems), at least as nicely as the Audi OEM units.
The Pioneer solution included sat nav. The way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel (the screen), by 90 degrees.
At the time, I thought, ""Gawd that looks soo after-market"" -- they (meaning Audi) need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash, not copy this fugly looking contraption. Once Audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7"" widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash, I thought we'd taken a big step forward in interior design.
BTW, why buy one of these $50K cars without navi, etc and smack a Tom Tom or Garmin unit onto a patch of Velcro every-time you get in the car? Or even more inexplicable, why buy one of these high-buck cars without nav and then spend a king or queen's ransom to retro-fit the OEM nav system (literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place)?
Virtually all the car-buff magazines agreed -- for years and years -- ""No one does interiors better than Audi.""
I got my 2005 A6 with all options, meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for, acting as my navi screen, as well as radio screen, telephone screen, etc etc etc.
As an aside -- I've had BlueTooth for 10+ years and I saw a Honda commercial last night on TV where you'da thunk the new 2015 Honda Civic ""now with bluetooth"" was making some cutting edge revelation. What's that about? I mean, seriously, I've had bluetooth for over 10-years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new Honda ""as if"" the thing is a leader in Automotive Electronics.
My 2009 A4 had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 A6 dash and, of course, added a back-up camera (which didn't come to the A6 until the 2006 model year). Don't get me started again on Honda's cutting-edge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car ""as if"" it was the second coming!
Then, I start looking at the new A6's that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn Pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up EVERY time you started the car. The salesperson says ""OK, if you don't like it, you can push a button to keep it hidden."" Sure you can, but you'll miss radio info, telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time -- so, you can't really keep that stick-em-up screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the cars systems.
That damn pop-up aftermarket looking thing was/is one of my pet peeves about the then (2012) current CTS -- but at least Cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position.
It looks even worse on the A3, since the dash is soo plain (barren from the middle to the passenger side, really.)
The Macan, TODAY, has taken over for the best NEW dash, if you axe me. Audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the A6 and A3 right away, like NOW. The A4 and A5 (for 2015) dash may be a bit dated, but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as modernistic. Audi, look at the Macan's dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant -- that should be YOUR dash-look.

It's two-fold. First, it's safer to navigate the Pandora app through the vehicle's infotainment center than it is to try and control it through your phone. Voice controls and steering wheel controls reduce the need to pick up the phone to use Pandora. Second, it's a marketing push. With Pandora in the infotainment system like Sirius/XM and terrestrial radio, you are more prone to use it which shows greater users/ratings and allowing them to sell higher priced advertising.
I have Pandora on my phone and never use it in the car. It's too much of a pain to use the phone while driving a stick shift in the city."
1731,markcincinnati,August 2014,"Most of the technologies that surprise and sometimes shock me for coming to the party so late are very inexpensive (and have been for some time).
I can actually understand why ABS took a long time to ""trickle"" down. But, according to so many ""experts"" the single most valuable technology to come along is/was the electronic stability program (ESP) -- or just stability control. Once ABS is in place (my first car with it was built in 1986) adding ESP is relatively inexpensive. Yet it took perhaps 15 years to get it into ""mainstream"" cars even though it had been proven to be a life saver and a money saver since it was almost magical in its ability to help a driver avoid an unwanted crash (as if there are ""wanted"" crashes, eh?).
Same with the backup camera -- cheap to implement and very valuable.
Wait a minute, now I remember my dealer telling me that ESP was a $550 option for a couple of years on Audi products and that sunroofs were $1,250 (and not actually used that much), but that people would almost always opt for the sunroof they'd use twice a year and omit the ESP charge proclaiming ""It's just an electronic nanny, I don't need it.""

I know it may sound like blasphemy, but I'm really curious about the new 2015 Genesis 4-door sedan. Priced here in the ELLPS pack, certainly doing a great cover as an ELLPS (wishing they were, I assume, an LPS, which won't be too much of a stretch over the next few years, I'd imagine).
If I thought I could count on any of y'all to start mass quantities of test-drives, I'd pass on doing that, at this time.
My wife and I must be outliers -- test driving is a serious hobby for us; and it is free, and about every 36 months we drop about $100K or more on a couple of new cars, and the dealer group we use to take our test drive adventures knows it, so there's always a willingness to let us go out and explore.
Seems like a decent number of folks here probably do the same thing in terms of being in the market -- but y'all (and I grant I could be wrong) don't seem to be taking out the latest and greatest to see what's what.
Think of it this way -- a new restaurant comes to town; I'm assuming most (51%) folks here eat out -- A LOT -- well you probably give the new eatery a go. The characteristics of the ELLPS and LPS ""buyers"" is (I've assumed with the data points y'all share here) would seem to indicate you're -- most of you anyway -- auto mavens (experts or connoisseurs). You like to ""dine"" (drive) the new restaurant (auto). True dat?
I also assume y'all subscribe to at least two of the ""big"" car magazines and devour them both in print and on-line.
Well the challenge I'll throw out -- and there is no prize for winning -- is to get into the new cars and drive them, then sign on here and tell us a story, whet our appetites for all things automotive (or at least ELLPS and/or near-LPS). Make the others here -- force or compel the rest of us -- HAVE to take out the car you drove to experience it for yourselves.

I must have something wrong with me -- for I use my nav system every day, every single day. I leave for work in the AM and I punch up my nav system, set the scale to 4 miles, which is enough to capture two Interstate highways that I may have to travel.
Wait 5 seconds.
The screen paints a series of red, yellow or green outlines along either the north/south or east/west route that I must travel to get from sub-urban Cincinnati to the CBD (where I need to be). If I see too much red painted on the Interstates (275 or 71), I know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so I take a secondary road route -- and I often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me.
I also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time.
Hell, I play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to assist me in my journey.
To each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ELLPS's and LPS's take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids.
I was in a meeting in Lexington KY (80 miles south of Cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that I would just input the address into the car's nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn't give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav.
A Garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being integrated with the rest of the car's ""avionics"".) It is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in.
Hence my frequent close: Drive it like YOU live. I submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet.

Like everything in mass this will be slow - as this is a 2012 announcement, and they have not marketed an app or website. tsure they have signs everywhere and they do have real time traffic to certain exits on highways but this does not help in planning a trip. So it's great when you are already sitting in traffic and it tells you it's 30 mins to go another 10 miles,

New features and functions could be loaded into the dash's brain just like an app can be downloaded into your smartphone.
Certain things, I'm sure, would require hardware upgrades, but heck, make everything a module (as if it isn't already in a lot of cases) that could be plucked out like a radio head unit and replaced with new technology. And, why not make things at least one, if not more generations backwardly compatible (with some loss of functionality).
Right now I want to update (replace actually) that piece of crap Audi Connect ""hardware"" that apparently, forces me to have but ONE choice, other than to go without -- T-Mobile. I go less than 5 miles and the connection drops to 2G, which totally kills Google Maps and the eye in the sky-view on the screen. Even 3G isn't all that great.
Yet, right there, on the showroom floor is an A3 with 4G LTE -- which is pretty much like being there (and the carrier is AT&T which works about 98% of the time compared with T-Mobile's 70% of the time.) There must be a ""module"" under the dash that is nothing more than a ""smart phone"" without the phone case.
Or, why not allow the ""phone"" to be ""unlocked"" and allow, via software, me to use another, more reliable carrier.
Heck, for all I know T-Mobile is great (just not in Ohio), elsewhere.
Update-able tech, that's what's next -- or at least it should be. Of course, I think EVERYTHING should be standard on the car as it comes from the factory. Then, if you want the option, you pay for it -- you don't get rid of the car. This could even be done for many engine performance enhancements -- base cars comes with 200HP and 200 ft/lbs of torque. Pay the man (the dealer) to turn on the next level up the performance ladder and the engine now cranks out 250HP and 275 ft/lbs., etc etc.
I'm not suggesting a basic BMW 3-series come to market equipped with a software hobbled M3 powerplant -- awaiting someone to pay for the upgrade to have the secret code entered.

1755,andys120,August 2014,"Our Epic ELLPC Road Trip
My wife and I recently completed an extensive motor tour of the Intermountain West in our 2001 BMW 330 Ci Cabriolet. Sometimes in this topic we lose sight of the fact that these cars aren't just about high tech features and luxury appointments, they're about enjoying driving . I thought I'd give you some impressions about what it's like to take one of these ELLP cars on an extensive road trip.
I'm not going to give you a travelogue of what we saw and did but talk about the journey, which, if you love to drive, is as important as the destinations. I'm well aware that the convertible version of the Three Series isn't the sort of vehicle most would choose for such a trip, in fact the default choice for such long-distance touring is a motor home/RV or Fifth-wheel trailer. I understand the appeal of such vehicles but pros get paid good money for driving large heavy vehicles because driving them is a chore, at least IMO.
If you love driving and haven't driven in the Far West you should put it on your bucket list. You can really drive out there, speed limits are high and traffic enforcement is light. The roads (with some notable exceptions*) are in beautiful shape and even the Interstates have dramatic curves, steep grades (up to 7%!) and the most spectacular scenery you'll see anywhere.
Our 14 year old Bimmer performed beautifully without any problems other than a healthy appetite for 91 Octane (we averaged 28 MPG) and took to the highway as an autobahn-bred car should. We always had more than enough power and brakes to handle anything and the sublime steering made every mile a pleasure.
The major drawback of course was the small size, it wouldn't be suitable for more than two on such a long trip. We took advantage of the feature that allows one to flip away the recess where the top goes when it's down which greatly increased luggage space but robbed us of the ability to cruise topless until had we offloaded the bags. I've been a convertible guy for a long time but I wouldn't care to go more than two or three hours w the top lowered anyway. Thanks to the well-designed top, the Three-er Cabrio makes a very nice Grand Touring coupe w the top in place
.
After 20 days, 4500 miles and 8 states (AZ/UT/ID/OR/MT/WY/NV) we arrived home tired but satisfied after a great drive in a wonderful car.
*Western roads are generally in fine shape with a couple of notable exceptions (mostly in Montana and I-40 in Western AZ is surprisingly bad give the state's rep for good roads) but they are littered with ""Road Alligators"", shreds of truck tires, one of which tore up the lower front grille and left side fog light. This is surprising in light of the proliferation of truck inspection stations. Don't they ever notice that the tires on these big rigs are crap?

1758,sweendogy,August 2014,@andres3‌ - I think the back up camera plus beeping things are a great help in my s4 - but the camera and the beeps are just an aid in backing up. Sorry to hear about the friends situation but hard to blame a camera for user error. To each is own on optioning a car but cameras should and will be standard on all cars- fact is they help and the govt has taken notice and I'm sure insurance companies are going to be happier too.

What been the outcome in getting the insurance company to give you diminished value on your car?
I finally stopped being cheap and hired the collision claims consultants that were recommended to me for a professional unbiased independent diminished value appraisal that finally happened mid-August. It refutes the DV appraisal Mercury (at fault insured's company) paid for where they claimed my car sustained no structural damage (what about pulling an upper right rail isn't structural)? claimed it could be a certified used Audi still (no dealer I talked to seems eager to Certify a $22K+ repair billed S4. Car Max saw bolts spun on the hood and fender and that was enough for them to only offer wholesale price at $37K. They claimed they'd wholesale it, but part of me thinks they'd turn around and list it for $10K more at $47K.
Based on their ""outside the ballpark of reality"" DV report, Mercury only offered $1K for DV. They upped it to 1.5K in a fake attempt to settle the claim.
I've now sent my demand based on a ""REAL"" report that seems to be in the ball park of reality at $8850 DV amount. Plus the $445 fee and the $2,400 for rental car and insurance deductible expenses. I know they only have a $10K pot to pay out, so I'll settle for $10K total. They just want to delay this claim forever, and their tactics to frustrate me worked. I should of hired this DV Appraisal company from the beginning; I was wasting time without their help.
I now have 20 boiler plate letters to refute the predictable excuses and false claims/reasons they can't pay my demand. It's kind of hilarious the letters I received answer and refute some of the BS reasons I've already been given.
Each letter gives them 15 days to respond in writing which is more than reasonable. I predict they will offer to split the difference between their $1K DV report and my 8.8K DV report. One of the 20 letters is ready to go on that excuse. Their report is just so inaccurate, and the CarMax appraisal will help show that if need be.
Could take 4 to 5 more letters going back and forth before I get paid, or worst case scenario, I have to take them to small claims court for $10K. The thing is these letters help build a ""bad faith lawsuit/claim"" if they refuse to pay up, so maybe a lawyer would take my case at that point. No lawyers seemed interested in talking to me over a potential $15K property damage claim.
Next time someone hits me my neck and back is going to hurt a lot.

The insurance industry at times have created business to help those who are bring screwed by them...

1771,markcincinnati,September 2014,"When I pulled up to the sidewalk and parked in the No Parking zone, the boys’ bicycles were on their kick stands under the porte cochère at the back of the public library where the night drop off for books and, in my case, DVD’s is located. The library wouldn’t be open for more than an hour, so I assumed the boys were just there to get out of the hot morning sun. I put the DVD’s into the slot, nodded at the boys and turned around heading back to my idling car. Just about when I got to the driver’s door, one of the boys said “How much did that [car] cost?” I replied, “How much do you think?” The young man and his friend yelled back in unison, “A lot!” I told them it cost about $57,000, and I heard oo’s and ah’s in response. I drove off, giving them a quick honk and a wave.
What’s the point?
The point is, I’ve been thinking, saying and writing about what I assumed is the pending death of the automobile as most of us here know and love it. I’ve been of that opinion because it seems to me that virtually anyone under the age of 35 (or maybe under-30) seems as if they could care less about cars beyond them being appliances or means to get from point-to-point. These “young people” wouldn’t or couldn’t talk about cars if you threatened them with pain and death, and wouldn’t even bother to feign interest to win the new not-yet-released iPhone 6, so little interest do these folks seem to have in cars. These two young men gave me hope!
Now, I’ll bet when you and I were in our formative (‘tween through teen-age) years, we had but several topics we cared to opine about: Cars, Girls [or boys] and Sex. I my case, I was a budding audiophile, too, which kind of rounded out the whole emerging nerd stereotype. Had there been personal computers (of any stripe) or video games available (it was the early to mid-60’s and such tech had not yet been introduced to the mainstream market), I most certainly would’ve been into them; but instead I was into “stereo” in addition to cars, girls and sex (talking about sex, not actually having it, of course).
So when I was with my buds, the topic was often the “cars we were gonna be driving” as soon as we turned 16. We were dreamers, of course – we, then, were the kids sitting at the library entrance (where else?) watching the guy drive up in his new 1965 Bonneville pillar-less four-door painted in dark blue metallic with a ton of chrome accents and shiny chrome hub-caps and big ol’ tires (white walls, of course).
“Hey mister, how much did that thing cost?” The reply, at the time, was “About $4,000,” and of course we then obliged by making the same oo and ah sounds like the ones I heard the other morning.
My overarching point to this erudite group of auto enthusiasts here at Edmunds is that I believe we are pretty much smitten with cars and everything to do with them – but that we’re also mostly predisposed to acquire one of these Premium (or near-premium) Class cars based on history, loyalty or perhaps even looks. I would submit if you’ve had more than one representative of the same brand (back to back), that your next car is perhaps pre-ordained to come from that manufacturer. Loyalty to a brand is – along with several other characteristics – another sign that you are passionate about cars. You’ve come to identify yourself with BMW’s (a quite common occurrence here in Cincinnati) – you are a “BMW guy”. My friend, now President of his second software company had an Acura when I met him. In our times in the car often driving from Cincinnati to Chicago or to Bowling Green (KY), he would go on and on about what I’m convinced must be the best car in the world – at least he certainly thought so: the BMW M5. This guy was about 10-years my junior.
Thankfully he didn’t have to keep the Acura long – so less than a year after I met him he leased his first (of many) BMW’s – a 3-series. Followed by a 5, then a 7 then one of the “Z” car convertibles (he called that one Penis).
I submit that most of us here are (or want to be) “XXX” guys (intended to be gender neutral, don’t you know). You’re a Mercedes maven, you’re a BMW bigot and I’m an Audi aficionado. No matter what “empirical” data is brought to bear, you’re sure your new IS 350 F-Sport is superior to that guy’s BMW 328 – after all, Car & Driver says so; and, you just know you can run circles around the Bimmer’s 4-cylinder, turbo and all.
So it is with the foreknowledge that no matter how much evidence I can produce to the contrary, you will remain steadfast that your own sagacity has been validated and put on display for all to see by your choice of the latest and greatest Volvo S60 (or whatever).
So where does that leave us?
With hope, I hope.
The upcoming generation still needs to ratchet up their passion for all things automotive – or we could be doomed to forever being but passengers in our autonomous vehicles. But, I think there is some evidence, not much, but a little, that there are kids who are just as interested in cars as they are video games, social media (and, hopefully, sex).
There may be some hope, too, that those of “us” who may not as of yet yet been inculcated by a Brand of automobile, may find our personal automotive archetype and to coin a phrase, “Live long and prosper.”
I’ll close by saying this: While I still remain convinced that the Audi S4 is the best representative of the Entry-level Luxury Performance Sedan (and for the money it damn well ought to be), I must say, after having visited the Acura dealer to “See what’s new,” that the new TLX SH-AWD in Advance trim (the one with the 6-cylinder), ought to be this category’s leader if “price” (MSRP) is factored in. If you haven’t checked out this exact configuration (I can’t offer the same praise for the lesser TLX’s), I urge you to do so before you spend one dime on a new ELLPS car – this thing (the 2015, to be clear) is IMPRESSIVE!

This is gettin' serious now: ""Nissan Plans to Make Autonomous Driving Common by 2016""
-- Motor Trend, October 2014; Pg - 26
You know what Pogo said: ""We have met the enemy and he is us.""
Well ""us"" -- and we know who we are -- killed (or at least put it on its death-bed) the stick shift. Now, of course that's only partially true -- at least if you even a tiny bit agree that the DSG (aka PDK) dual clutch 'automatic manual' transmission is (and I hate to say this) equal to or better than the best manual transmissions ever made. But so few of ""us"" actually have these marvelous inventions -- and, I'll wager, the number of folks with the excellent 8-speed automatics available is also still somewhat small.
I can only sort of forgive YOU and hold my head up high with righteous indignation: Because god knows my wife and I did our parts to preserve the manual transmissions going so far as to custom order nearly 2-and-a-half-dozen German cars with stick shifts since 1977 (we finally quit this practice out of the sheer futility of the act when we realized that [most of] the rest of YOU -- overwhelmingly -- had given up on stick shifts years earlier). And, my wife was appalled to read some of lame excuses, most of them blaming ""the wife"" for her inability to pilot a car with a stick shift.
Of course, there is always that nagging feeling that the mobile phone also played a big part in killing the stick shift; even today it seems I don't have enough digits to count the number of cars I see being driven down the road with the driver holding a cell phone to his or her ear. So what? I forgot to mention the ""phones in the ear"" (thus requiring one free hand) I am counting are for the drivers' of cars that I know have Bluetooth! These drivers should be forced to ride the bus for one-full-year or pay a 5-figure fine (or both). This morning, in fact, I saw a woman (phone in ear) in a very young Maserati (with temp tags it was so new) pulling into Starbucks. I could only wonder if she was going to attempt to be on the phone and drink coffee all the while driving in rush hour traffic here in River City.
The point? Qwit yur complainin', for the Market has spoken.
But this latest outrage -- autonomous driving (by 2016 no less) -- is, some will say, both inevitable and welcome. Perhaps. It is also inevitable that we will -- eventually -- run out of fossil fuel. But we're talking decades and decades if you believe many of the scholarly studies from think tanks like the Rand Corporation to name one.
Mean time, WHO (among us) is asking for self-driving cars? I'd rather pay more taxes (and I can't believe I said that) if some of them could be earmarked for public transportation infrastructure improvements and additions. A one-person (or 4 person) public transportation vehicle (manifested in the form of a self-driving passenger vehicle), is not something I want to sign up for.
On the other hand, I do want driver aids: laser headlights, night-vision, ""city safety"", all around-view cameras, rear cross traffic alerts -- even automatic cruise control for those 100+ mile stints behind the wheel that are part of my weekly routine trips between Cincinnati and Columbus or Cincinnati and Louisville or Indianapolis.
I want a connected car (better even than that which is in my 2014 S4: ""Audi Connect""), but I still want to press the pedals (most of the time, anyway) and turn the steering wheel myself.
I am [now, happily] resigned to allowing my dual-clutch 7-speed automatic manual transmission to do the rowing for me, but I am far, far, far from wanting my car to drive itself. Indeed, I'm mostly sure I don't even want the thing to park itself, thank you very much.
The only good news in the Nissan announcements (if you can call it ""good"") is that Nissan claims they will NOT ELIMINATE the need for human interaction (like some competitors -- gulp).
""There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. Resolve then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tinny blast on tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may be us.""

I just don't think they have enough ""skill"" in their work force Still, for my money I think the ""body shop"" in Ingoldstadt is superior and better. Audi proved to me they do tremendous quality control with this S4 at the factory. They obviously build them to appease guys like me that notice when gaps and panels are off by a MM or two.
This last visit was to correct inconsistent gaps with the front hood, lack of buffing/polishing on the front fender and front quarter/fender panels, and 2 bad paint edges at 2 locations on the hood (which was replaced).
I drove a new NON SH-AWD 6 cyl. TLX and wasn't impressed at all. The transmission is lazy, why'd they give the 4 cyl the better tranny? Why no exhaust? Why less HP than the outgoing TL SH-AWD? This is your Camry/Prius-like TLX.
Perhaps the SH-AWD is another animal? Admittedly, putting the transmission in sport or sport+ mode made it less lazy, but still lacking. I heard the dual clutch still has a torque converter. NO NO NO Acura... no no no.

The number of years before the literal elimination of manual transmissions even from some of the performance stalwarts is damn few. The number of years before the virtual elimination of manual transmissions is even fewer, and some would say that time has already arrived.
The truth (my truth, at this point) of the matter is that the 7-speed (and most of the German/European 8-speed versions) is (are) so good, I only miss shifting for sentimental reasons.
I don't think I ever was as capable (and certainly not as quick/fast) a shifter as the S-Tronic in my S4. And, the tuning of my wife's 8-speed in her SQ5 is very very close to that same ideal.

My sales guy happens by, greets me, looks at my iPad to see I'm looking at trade value and invoice numbers on the TLX. He laughs and said, "".....TLX is too new for a GG type deal. I'll call you in 6 more months, though. We van hammer something then when the supply catches up with demand.""

That put's us right after the New Year. They're really nice cars. Acura has done a nice job.

And yet there is someone in another thread who would absolutely not consider the new TLX because of the commercial Acura created for it.

In fairness, I am seeing a number of non-professional drive reports from interested parties/potential buyers that are not at all positive, so that weighs heavily against it too. Could Acura have badly missed the mark?

1805,graphicguy,September 2014,"AB.....from the reviews I've seen, the TLX is been rated from positive, to very positive. You're going to have the ""Fast and Furious"" crowd that laments the omission of ground effects, ""go fast"" spoilers, etc. They still want the ""blaaaaaat"" exhaust cans that you won't get on a TLX. Matter of fact, like a lot of upscale cars, there's no visible exhaust pipes at all on the TLX.

I know it's early, but the numbers suggest Acura has a hit on their hands with. They want to sell 44K of them over 12 mos. They are on track to sell 50K to 60K (probably closer to 50K once the initial flurry slows down).

Something for everyone....4 cyl with DCT, and all wheel steer or 6 cyl. with SH AWD if you want it. As good in the tech dept as anything else on the road, and probably better than most. Performance that's competitive. Value equation that is probably best in class.

Plus, they're about darn near impossible to break, they last a long time, and they don't cost much to maintain or operate.

That's a winner to me.

1814,benjaminh,September 2014,"Although the TLX is based on the Accord, they actually did several significant structural upgrades, included use of even higher grades of steel. Here's some stuff from the Acura press release about that:

http://www.acura.com/PressReleases.aspx

""High strength steel uses include:

UISBOR – USIBOR is a boron-alloyed steel with an aluminum-silicon coating that protects against oxidation during the heating, forming and hardening process. This high-strength hot-stamp steel is used for the TLX's door opening rings, for 5% of the unit body. (See Safety section for more information.)
980 grade HSS – Used in certain key structural points such as the front edges of the door sills, and in the A-pillars and B-pillars, for 2% of the unit body.
780 grade HSS – Used for most structural load paths for ACE™, including the side sills and forward spars of unit body, for 2% of the unit body.
590 grade HSS – Used for the front frame spars, floor and roof supports, for 35% of the unit body...

Magnesium Steering Hanger Beam
Located behind the instrument panel, a 3-piece magnesium steering-hanger beam replaces the 26-piece aluminum and steel unit in the previous TL model. Its purpose is as a structural attachment point for the steering column, pedals and instrument panel, as well as a structural element that helps the passenger cabin retain its shape in certain collisions. This single robust magnesium component makes up 2-percent of the TLX's body weight....""

1815,stickguy,September 2014,"OK, stopped at the dealer yesterday, and had a chance to see the TLX in person (did not drive, will do that when I take my TL in for an oil change soon).

they had a couple of black ones on the apron (did not scope out due to pouring rain). But, there was a graphite lustre (same color as my RDX) in the showroom. a V6 FWD. Overall, very nice. Loved the looks. Even the front end was sharp, particularly the headlights. Beak did not offend. the rest of the car had enough curves and design points to be interesting, without feeling overwrought.

Interior, very nice. pretty much shares the dash with the MDX it seems (the RDX and ILX are close to each other too). Well done. Nice, clean dash and very ""Acuraish"" super duper comfy seats. back seat to me was fine. I am 6' with a long torso, and had no problem with leg or head room. Might not be quite as big as the Legacy we drove, but plenty of space for 4 adults. Trunk was acceptable.

not a huge car, but certainly seemed to fit the entry level luxury profile. Performance? Well, the V6 is going to be fast, just based on how fast my RDX is, and the TLX s/b lighter and has more gears.

oh, the ""shifter"" gizmo on the V6 was a bit odd. Simple to use, but just strange. Did not get a chance to see a 4 cyl which has a normal gear shift.

I plan to drive a 4 cyl base car if they have one available in the next week or 2 when I go back down.

my one big peeve? They pulled a Hyundai and deleted the spare tire. No run flats (a good thing) but just a can of fix a flat, and a cheap pump. I just refuse to own a car that has no back up plan for a bad tire. Did not explore/question if you could just take out the foam tray under the trunk floor and put a donut in there. Heck, the Legacy not only had a tire, it was on a matching alloy wheel! and per the salesman, was rated for 200 miles.

1818,tlong,September 2014,"I rented a BMW 328 last week while staying in Las Vegas.

In short, I was particularly underwhelmed by this car. This is coming from somebody who currently drives an '05 TL and previously had a 6 cylinder Audi A4.

The BMW was black and is gorgeous outside. I was a bit surprised at how low the roof is on this car - definitely not a lot of headroom.

Since it's a rental, I'll grant that this was probably a downmarket trim level vehicle. The seats were black and I'm not sure if they were leather or leatherette - I suspect the vinyl as they didn't have a leather smell. The seat bottoms were very flat with almost no bolstering. In general, although the car did have nav, I didn't feel the interior was very upmarket. Seemed pretty middling to me - not as cheap as entry-level cars, but certainly not luxe, either. The trunk is large laterally but is shallow.

The automated nanny behavior had me screaming thoughts of repair costs had I owned this car. The electronic shifter seemed more gimmicky than useful. The auto-engine shutoff was exactly as has been described here - unrefined and jerky on restart. Yes, you can disable it but you need to do that every time you get back in the car.

I thought the steering was a bit numb and vague on-center. The ride was decent but not that quiet. The engine was refined for a 4 but not all that smooth to me. I didn't push the car as I was in traffic, but this car firmly convinced me that I didn't want to pay north of $40K for a 3-series."

1820,graphicguy,September 2014,"One of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder, that things like metallic paint was a costly option. My former S4, which didn't have metallic paint, made it available for a fairly significant extra charge. I think my 335i had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near $600 extra. My TL's? No extra charge. And, Acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to boot....easily as good as anything else on the market, most times better.

While Acura isn't immune to trying to get people to pay more for leather, all but the base TLX's have leather....and it is a very nice leather....soft, high quality. MB tries to push their vinyl to be as good as leather. From what I can tell, they seem to do a good marketing job on that front.

Was in Costco last night. They always seem to have BMWs in the front as an enticement to use their car buying service. They had a 435i xDrive with the M Sport package....dark metallic grey with red leather interior. It was equipped exactly the way I'd want it. Very nice.

The ""upgraded sound system"" is only speakers and amp, not head unit. I also think the reason for not supporting FLAC has to be the HD space. Since the files would be too large.

In regards to sound quality, and this subject has been beaten to death on the forums like Car Audio also people like Harry Kimura (he lives in San Diego and is the grand father of the modern day aftermarket sound competition) if you truly want sound quality in your S4 then contact usdaudio.com/ they are the only people who I would allow to touch my car. Sound Quality comes at a price, and that weigh and space. So if you could get your FLAC files to work, they wouldn't sound all that much different especially driving down the road. If you think your S4 is quite now, you should hear what 200lbs of sound deadening will do to your car. But then it comes at a price, added weight..

I think I answered that, and the answer is no, well unless you add about 200 lbs of sound deadening to the car. People who compete in the car audio competition spend HOURS making their cars as quite as possible. When they go through the SQ (Sound Quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin. This is why I said to use a CD instead of the FLAC files. Who remembers DAT (Digital Audio Tape) players poor Panasonic (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make CD's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of CD's but did not hold the same amount of music as the CD.

Funny thing, to me at least, Acura put the transmission that the paid car reviewers seem positive about in the 4-cylinder rather than in the high contented, big motor, SH-AWD version.

The TLX 8-speed dual clutch (but with torque converter -- a rarity) transmission in the 4 is everyone's darlin'. Then the review turns ugly by suggesting that the 9-speed V6 just feels [essentially] fat, sluggish (due to its apparent porky-ness) and a lot less fun.

On the other hand, the new C-Class is lauded as a baby S class.

Who's driven these here? Tell me more, tell me more -- in many ways, your opinions are the ones that matter most."
1846,markcincinnati,October 2014,"The ""She's Too Fat Polka""!

Not too long back, I took out a new S6 and was smitten by the intoxicating power of the thing, as well as its ability to blend sportiness and luxury into one sweet, sophisticated and sporty package.

Another month, about, has passed with my S4 -- now at 17,300 miles.

And, while I am certain another wild drive in an S6 would have me again tumescent with desire for this $80K super-sedan, it's just too damn fat, too big in the overall scheme of things. What would be really to my tastes, with the benefit of hindsight now, would be a slightly larger S4 -- add about an inch or so to the wheelbase, make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the SQ5 engine in it (for the added torque, natch). Open it up just a smidge in size and power -- 333HP and 325 ft/lbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward.

Here we sit with no new 4's coming until 2016 MY and, if history repeats, no new S4 for at least another year (or two) beyond that.

Now, if someone wanted to provide me with a new S6 for a couple of years at no charge, well, you can be certain I would not re-gift it.

My comments pertaining to my opinion that the S4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of ""situational velocitization"". That is what used to feel really quick and fast, well, feels simply ""normal"" these days.

The only cure for this velocitization is to get an A4 2.0T loaner for a day or two, so I can essentially push my quickness and speed reset button, for there is surely no lack of quickness or speed in my S4 -- I've just gotten used to it so much I take it for granted.

Drive it like you live."
1847,sweendogy,October 2014,"Mark I just had a 15 loaner a4 - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days. With The new s3 at almost 3oohp I would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but I have not seen any publications on this figure. Maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the Sq5 's 350ish listing. I would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock sq5 - something tells me they are closer the you think."

Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP. Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there. For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)?

If my assumption on that matter is correct, perhaps AoA will lobby for whatever the next lower HP (below 400) is but press for more readily available torque. Economy and emissions, too, would have to be a consideration, no?

The current 3.0T in the S4 puts out a conservative 333HP and 325 pound feet. The beefed up version in the SQ5 adds 21HP (taking it to 354) and 21 pound feet (getting us to 346). The crank is a heavier duty part than in the S4 iteration and apparently the SQ5 engine is ""strong enough"" to be cranked to another like increase without breaking much, if any, of a sweat.

A new model S4 with 375HP and 367 pound feet might just be the Goldilocks answer (at least in the US). This would leave plenty of ""headroom"" for either a blown V8 or an even more tightly tuned V6 (T) to be fitted into an RS4 model. Indeed, based on what is easily do-able these days with plain ol' ""normal"" forced induction (super or turbo), twin-charging (super AND turbo) or other, ""compound induction"" derivatives, I wouldn't be shocked to ""hear-tell"" of an S4 with a 4 cylinder engine of some-kind or another, putting out an easy-peasy 350HP with gobs of low end torque, either.

Program note:

For reasons that would require at least two more paragraphs, I will tell you that I was cruising along at about 67 MPH on I-71 N (north of the I-275 interchange this Saturday PM last). I had the ""need"" to ""punch it"" -- and for the count of 1, 2, 3 floored the S4, cleared the incident, glanced at my digital read-out and found it reading 100. Under the circumstances (light traffic, four lanes heading north, etc), I was simply able to coast down to a relatively legal 68 without the need for the dampers. I realize the S6 seemed to do this exact same thing in what I ""recall"" as 1,2,3 -- the difference is that the S6 did so with practically zero drama. The S4 made all kinds of fun sounds as it made the jump to light speed.


Newer S4's will, due to market conditions, surely come with more grunt than current versions, but for the life of me, I find it difficult to imagine ever being able (or rarely so) to use such power.

1,2,3 -- the thing is like a freakin' sling-shot.

Dizzy with the rush of speed, I leave you saying ""Drive it like you live""!"

An article on the BMW 320i from our friends at Consumer Reports.

1850,flightnurse,October 2014,"Mark interesting thought, and you are probably right, look at the 335i 300hp and torque, with the MPPK and MPE you are looking at 335-340hp easily and BMW is very conservative with their HP rating. The current M3/4 makes 425hp (but a recent dyno test shows the M4 making 435hp at the rear wheel) so if Audi where to bring a RS4 you would right to saying it would be 400+hp, more like 450hp and not from a V8, but from a V6.

I have not driven a new M3/4 yet but from articles they are some scary machines, the amount of power they make can be very over whelming, do cars of that size need more HP? Right now, the biggest issue BMW has with the M3/4 is getting the rear wheels to hook up.

And Mark if I had a M4 and drove it like I lived, I wouldn't have a license..."
1851,markcincinnati,October 2014,"Flight -- even with the 333HP my S4 claims to have (which Motor Trend says is an understatement), I can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks.

Of course, with all the crazy people on I-71 North heading from Cinti to Columbus thinking 80MPH is a good place to START, well, there may be safety in numbers.

I can't seem to make this thing slow down -- I mean it seems that it keeps pushing me to go faster and the heck of it is, I'm too willing to abide.

I saw the Motor Week test report of the M3 -- talk about trying to control the wrath of gawd . . . . Even with the wider rear rubber the thing was wheel spin happy to the max.

I somehow doubt there will be an RS4 (or RS6) brought here -- the RS7 was, in my opinion, just a demonstration to show that Audi could bring a very high performance car to the US for what some see as a relative bargain. A higher output S4, well, that I am willing to bet will be brought here -- just like I'll bet there will be higher output ""335's"" brought here, too."

Say, coming from something like my 2007 Volvo (aka the ""putt putt mobile"") the 320 is still a seriously nice car. Is it the highest end? No, but it is cheaper.

you can pretty much make the same argument with the 328i. The 335 is faster/better, so if you aren't getting that, then you are cheaping out.

""The D"" touted by Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is here, and it's a dual motor, all-wheel-drive sedan with mind-bending performance numbers.

The improvements build on the company's current Model S, offering better traction, more driving range and futuristic automated features. And some serious speed.

Model S sedans equipped with Tesla's 85 kWh battery pack and the dual-motor all-wheel-drive system will be able to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in just 3.2 seconds. That puts it in the same league as high-performance cars including the Porsche 911 Turbo and the Mercedes-Benz E63.

Tesla does a nice job of telling you how much you will save in fuel and time and whatever- they also give you nice lease options and other financing tools- but 80-100k for the one I would want is way to much- even with the cool rear rumble seats that face like my dad's old caprice"
1857,brian125,October 2014,"I do agree with you about up here in the North East. RWD is terrible in winter months especially when you consider dropping this kind of coin. If you can afford to take it out of the garage for some pleasure driving 8 months out of the year that's fine. Last I looked the driving range was under 300 miles. That to me is unacceptable to travel around with a vehicle. Local driving this car is fine. I drive from NY to Myrtle beach 2 sometimes 3x a year.

Another problem is how many charging facilities are there through out the country. With pricing at 80k plus this vehicle is a toy for the rich and not for a family guy / most buyers .

1858,brian125,October 2014,"How about the Tesla Model X SUV. Is 70k worth a 95 mile range?


Base price: Currently unknown, but expected to be around $70,000.

Fuel economy: Unknown, but based on the Model S specs, expect a figure around 95 mpge from the 60kWh battery option.

Pros and cons: The Tesla Model X, expected out this fall, is the crossover to wait for if you want something truly different. In true Tesla style, it’s completely electric; it features falcon-wing doors that lift up and an all-wheel drive option that will make it the first production electric car to run on all fours; and it also has Tesla’s trademark 17-inch touchscreen center console. It has the usual EV drawbacks, though: limited range coupled with potentially long recharging times.

Options worth splurging on: It might come to the detriment of range, but the all-wheel drive model might be too good to pass up.

These vehicles are in the baby phases. Give this industry another 5 to 10 years with more research and cost cutting ways where most buyers can afford similar models like mentioned.

We were able to take one for a test drive. we drove a Model S 85, it wasn't fully loaded and MSRP was cough $98K , walking from the store to where the cars are at, the employee (not too sure what her tile was) had the car starting to cool off for us. After 20 minutes of showing us how some of the feature work, the key fob was given to me, and I have to say, what an impressive key fob, it is weighted and looks like the car very impressive. The first thing you notice when you settle into the car is how low it is and how long it is. The car had 21"" wheels so it rode a little on the rough side, and of course my tech geeky niece (she works for Sun Microsystems/Oracle) was playing with the center dash touch screen. As Sweeny said, Tesla could be (it really is) considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever. What can be said about elec motors that no one on this forum hasn't read about it, instead torque, scooting around traffic is not a problem, and if you drive it normal the car just purrs along. The car felt solid, but the closing of the doors didn't have the German feel when closing them. Leases are backed by Wells Fargo, and to lease this particular car it would have ran $1300/m with $7500 out of pocket, or purchase the car $1200/m with 10K down but with the 7500 federal tax credit really only 3K out of pocket. Tesla shows that one can build a pure elect car that is not boring and what the true cost of the car is without being subsidized my the motor-company.

If I could convince myself to spend $1200/m for a car I would get one in a heart beat, I love the design and the 265 miles range is not a problem, and I'm seeing more and more charging stations then ever before.

Now, still NOT having driven one, perhaps the TLX just seems like an expensive Accord -- but on paper, it would seem not.

Further, it seems far enough UNDER $50K to merit ""our"" attention.

Of course the car magazines are just giving the thing the briefest of ""test-reports"" -- and I would say the reviews from the performance perspective are rather mixed, despite the recognition that there seems to be a lot of car for the MSRP.

Stick....S4 is equivalent to a BMW 335i. Then again, it's equivalent to an Acura TL SH AWD that's a tad slower, too.

TLX is a nice ride. I compared the suspension to an E350 when I, test drove it. Tech is better than Mercedes, too. It's finished nicely and has great, premium materials, too. IMHO, it had the best stereo in the biz (ELS). Tranmission shifted quick and smooth enough you won't notice (similar to my E92 335i). Acura prgrammed the trans well. In sport, it will downshift almost telepathically.

The Legacy is a fantastic daily driver. The suspension is comfortable and very well tuned. The 175 horsepower is nothing to brag about, but it does get me up to speed.

I really like the CVT. If I wasn't such a car nut, I'd have no idea this wasn't a conventional automatic. The CVT is quite responsive and very smooth. It adds to the Legacy's overall character and refinement. I haven't had the traffic conditions to ""wring it out"" yet, but the car doesn't ""beg"" to be driven hard like my 328xi did.

1900,markcincinnati,October 2014,"S4 M3

Much as I love my S4, the M3 and S4 aren't in the same class -- Audi's S4 is the competitor to the BMW 335 (and to be fully comparative, the BMW would have to be an X-drive version.)

There is no RS4 (US) available which would be the M3's competitor.

I believe the S4 used to be the M3 rival, but once ""RS's"" were introduced the ""S"" moved a step down the performance ladder.

The net of this is to clarify that the S4 is still in the ELLPS category, no matter how much it can be optioned to (well over $60K in a New York second).

For the record, I wouldn't kick a 335 out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers.

Perhaps I lucked out with my S4 -- based on the way I equipped it; it seems the ""distance"" between an all singing, all dancing, S-Line A4 and an S4 is remarkably short. If you're looking at an A4 with a bunch of options, the S4 with not so many options, is just a smidge more (on a lease) than the ""lesser"" 4.

My wife's SQ5, Prestige, too, was ""within reach"" of a Q5 3.0T -- and, like the A4 S4 comparison, the ""S"" cars are remarkable, almost thrilling, performers.

The top of the line versions of most of the ELLPS cars are -- almost universally -- great performers available for something far less than a King's ransom. And, what you end up with is very close to the driving fun of a true sports sedan.

Of course, the ""bottom of the line"" of the ELLPS cars is/are still firmly planted as a card carrying member of the ELLPS family. Yet, for folks who frequent these formums and the brand specific sites, my assumption is that very few of us look to the ELLPS brand of our dreams and think, ""I'm gettin' me a strippie . . . ."" My conclusion is that the mavens who are participating here are more likely than not to equip their cars with a lot of performance and tech options -- and probably a fair amount of ""L""uxury features too.

The ELLPS class here on Edmunds, IMHO, has to be one of the most active boards and enjoys the participation of mostly very passionate (and opinionated) car lovers.

Much as I love cars like the S6 (if there are many ""like"" the S6), I think the S4 ""class"" (ELLPS) is really where the action and drama lie.

1901,sweendogy,October 2014,"Love the @markcincinnati‌ posts - flow so well. I also agree if 60k (msrp on my s4 was 57 and change) for Ellps is now the norm then the s4 (please get the sports diff for the 1k, it works magic) is the machine to beat even in its 5th year. I have to wonder thou what is ELLps- when I was looking at my G 35k was always a number I thought would be entry level lux. I really wonder what exactly is entry level performance and lux- Is it now 40k ? 50k? 60k? If it's over 50k and you are looking be hard pressed to find something better the s4- imo"

Then there are also some nice ELPS, too, but their luxury scope is often limited to couple of nice features. Ok machines, but not ELLPS. Another part is base version vs. optioned.

1907,flightnurse,October 2014,"Interesting video, Rick and I started the look for his SUV, and we went to the Volvo dealer and drove a XC60 with the E-Drive engine, this is a Super and Turbo Charged 2 liter engine, rated at 302hp and 295lbs of torque. Just as this video shows, the S60 just walks away from the TLX, as did the XC60 very impressed with the amount power it makes. So for 50K you get a fully loaded top of the line Volvo XC60 that can run with the other guys. I noticed that invoice for this SUV is 48K and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the Euro Delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, PLUS 2 round trip tickets to Sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance. This sweetens the deal a lot..

We also liked the Q5, a lot, and the 3.0 TDI torque is way addictive, so far the interior of the Q5 is our fave... The X3 was nice, the 2 liter diesel was hard press to complain about the power, We have more SUV's to look at, I'm looking forward in testing the Jeep Grand Cherokee with the diesel engine.

We drove a MDX, we both thought it was nice, but bulky and the lack of customizing made it fall off the list quickly. Now if you are on a budget and looking for a nicely loaded SUV then the MDX is one to look at. While at the dealer we look at the TLX and liked it, Acura did it right..."
1908,markcincinnati,October 2014,"I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point? Things have changed in 12 years.

The 335, the S4 and some incarnation of the Mercedes C class are ELLPS cars based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.

And, while I am certain you could find ELLPS cars all day long with ""about"" a $40K price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""P"" and ""L""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realistic level of $45K or more.

As I mentioned, I believe that because folks here on Edmunds are er, more passionate, about cars and they really do want both the P and the L, ""strippies"" of some of the ELLPS cars are probably not what we're opining about here.

Now, along comes the new ELLPS class, perhaps?

What [or, perhaps, WHERE does it belong?] is an A3 or more pointedly an S3? It/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ELLPS class. But perhaps with the 2016 current ELLPS models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the A3 (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ELLPS family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ELLPS space thus allowing the A3, S3 and the soon to follow cars from Asia, Europe and the US, to fill in as the NEW NORMAL ELLPS cars.

Of course, if that happens, where does a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or Volvo S60 or TLX, Q50 or, or, or, end up? A 3 series will not be welcome in the LPS forum discussions -- will it? A 3 series is not a 5 series an A4 is not an A6, and so forth.

The lines blur, they come into focus, they blur again; the cars get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released. A 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc. So what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)

What's between an ELLPS and an LPS anyway? PPPLPS - Popularly Priced Premium Luxury Performance Sedan (or would that be the step below ELLPS?) Or perhaps UMLPS - Updwardly Mobile Luxury Performance Sedan? Maybe NQQFBLPS - Not Quite Qualified to be a Full Blown Luxury Performance Sedan. No no, how 'bout ILLPS in keeping with the ""E"" for Entry -- we bump it up to: Intermediate Level Luxury Performance Sedan, and we move the current ELLPS players into the ILLPS class and move the up and coming ""Jr ELLPS's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ELLPS to ILLPS and so on . . .

Yeah, that's the ticket.

1914,markcincinnati,October 2014,"The RDX is FWD biased and currently can't be had with what used to be the RDX's secret sauce, SH-AWD. The RDX is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money.

It is, however, an appliance, a very good appliance but rather unremarkable if you are looking for anything beyond modest (and I think that is generous) performance.

The RDX, like all Acura's is probably one of the most reliable and I would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size CUV universe.

Life, as I now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring cars.

My vote would be for the X3 of the choices suggested -- but I did much appreciate the XC60 T6 when I floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the X3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.

The X3 however felt like it was on rails.

Here is the test I use -- I find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road. I look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most). Then I approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next I brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel. As I enter the curve at 30mph, I accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve.

If the car easily remains in its lane, I repeat the process at triple the posted speed.

The X3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. The RDX (old version with the turbo 4 and SH-AWD could do this all day.) The new one plows and crosses the center line. The XC60 was a T6 Type R and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too. But the Volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.

The X3 was the natural -- were money no object, the X3 with the i6 turbo would clearly be the one to get if you wanted some salt and pepper on your ""meat."""
1915,stickguy,October 2014,"well, as always, money comes into play. Big difference between stretching from a ""normal"" CUV to an RDX in the low-mid 30s, and jumping to a European hot rod for 50k+, if not pushing 60 large.

What was the reason for your wife getting the SQ5? over the X3? I find the interior of the Q5 a much more inviting environment over the X3, but the X3 did handle better I thought."
1918,carnaught,October 2014,"Mark, entertaining posts, as usual."
1919,markcincinnati,November 2014,"Simply put, the SQ5 -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior Audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the SQ5 had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot.

To get the same or similar content, the BMW was even more expensive; and I think she felt the SQ5's interior, sport seats in particular plus the B&O sound system cinched it -- almost. Panther Black Pearl paint sealed the deal. That plus a 6% discount on NOT your garden variety Q5 or X3 -- Audi iimbues its ""S"" cars with ""that certain something"" -- undoubtedly sealed the deal.

Having matching interiors was probably a minor influencer, too.

She has had 2 X3's since 2005 -- very fond of them. But, if you've never driven an SQ5 at full cry, you may not quite understand the almost immediate reaction: An ""addiction"" to the sound and the fury, wrapped up in what seems to be a premium CAR -- the BMW for all of its inherent goodness just doesn't seem as nice of a place to spend hours in. Then, of course, there is that oh-so-cute flat bottomed sport steering wheel on the SQ, too.

If you can take an SQ5 out for a test drive.

On the other hand . . .

The BMW is better balanced -- but the SQ passes the triple speed around the curve test with ease and poise. As a practical matter, that attribute felt pretty much like a draw, despite the BMW's less heavy nose. The Audi engineers did a very nice job taming the potetial understeer of the SQ's fatter front-end.

Just test drive an SQ -- perhaps you too will want to keep on driving it, long aafter the test drive ends. One more thing, the SQ5 is very rare, you won't see yourself coming and going -- the X3 even with the more potent i6 motivation is rather easy to find, and unlike the SQ seems to do little to differentiate itself from the ""regular"" X3."

2001 Prelude Type SH, 2022 Highlander XLE AWD, 2022 Wrangler Sahara 4Xe"
1923,markcincinnati,November 2014,"And the punchline is: ""He Only Took Tips!""

A tip for those who are either owners of or contemplating one of these ELLPS or ELLPSUV/CUV's -- assuming the vehicle in question is not a BMW.

Here goes: many, probably most of these cars tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. Audi is certainly not known for ""50 - 50"" weight balance, for instance. Acura, Volvo and most certainly others (again not BMW) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2WD vehicles (since they mostly are FWD when ordered thusly). More and more of these ELLP vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in SW Ohio is now for ""mostly"" AWD versions -- even most BMW's and Mercedes are acquired with AWD so say the dealers). Alas, even the AWD versions are nose-heavy.

The thing that I've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds MORE than the factory sticker suggests.

My S4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. I inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen ""air"" Costco offers its members).

We had a cold snap here in River City yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped dramatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimistic 41.

Since I was at Costco getting my fill up of their Top-Tier premium, I also went for the free air fill-up. Based on the length of time before the ""ding"" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that.

To ensure the tires were cold, I drove to Costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.

I kid you not -- and I've known this for years, yet I was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was IMMEDIATELY sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.

OK, that is the ""free"" (as in almost zero cost) tip.

Here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further dramatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ELLP vehicle's steering dynamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ELLP car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.

For example -- here in SW Ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses ""summer"" and ""winter"" tires -- they use either ""summer"" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.

The Germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rubber. Dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rubber to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).

The thing is, a lot of the ""all-season"" tires are either Grand Touring tires or are simply H rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).

My S4 came with H rated Grand Touring tires. What were they thinking? Offered up to order is an S4 with either summer or all-season tires. I checked the all-season box since, well, you know, I live in Cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. Why do I need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak?

I don't.

Grand Touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an Audi S car of any stripe.

What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy: an Ultra-High Performance All-Season tire from one of the name brands all of the German's buy from. We ended up with Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons from Tire Rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. These tires should have their picture placed beside the word ""sticky"" in your Merriam-Webster.

They have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased Grand Touring H rated rubber that the S4 came with) sidewalls and they are Y speed-rated. Of course, since I ordered my car with the all-season tire option, Audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130MPH).

So, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ELLP's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's ""suggestion.""

Then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these cars that you can order 20"" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly ""wimpy"" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these cars when the ""no summer only"" tire option is checked.

Virtually all of these ELLPS, ELLPSUV/CUV vehicles are nose heavy -- which manifests itself as under-steer. It is unlikely you can, as the saying goes, put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a Porsche in the handling department -- but, with my hand raised on high, I can attest that by doing both of the suggested tips above, I even transformed my TL Advance from somewhat of a farm-implement (i.e., it could tend to ""plow"" a little bit even with SH-AWD) due to its less than ideal 60-40 (or something like that) F/R weight distribution) into a confidence inspiring and -- with a consideration for its price -- ""S4-light"" ELLPS.

Of course, in the case of the Acura TL Advance w/SH-AWD the 19"" H rated tires that it came with couldn't have sucked anymore even if their name was Hoover (I crack myself up).

So, my friends and fellow posters, if you're laying out something north of $45,000, you can for no to relatively low money transform your baby from ""nice"" to a vehicle that, quoting my wife, ""goes like a snake in a rat hole.""

If you play your cards right, you can make the UHP all-seasons (or whatever you and your ""climate"" could call optimum) part of the purchase/lease deal when you order the car or before you sign on the dotted line to buy/lease one off the lot.

Hopefully the above will have some merit and even more $ value and most of all ""fun to drive"" value for at least one forum participant.

Drive it . . . oh hell, you know the rest."

I run the Cooper RS3-A UHP all-season as the winter tire on my MS3(the Michelin PSS is the summer tire) and year round on my son's X3 truck. It looks like I will get over 45k miles out of the tire in each application.

1929,markcincinnati,November 2014,"Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons have, as some here have alluded to, been somewhat dethroned in the most recent Tire Rack test:

""Michelin has reset the performance standard for an all-season tire with their Pilot Sport A/S 3, which delivers impressive handling in both dry and wet conditions. And while not apparent during our short road evaluation, when running laps on our test track at the limit this tire showed a little more tread wear than the others tires. But this focus on ultimate performance during the summer months compromises its wintertime capabilities somewhat. The Bridgestone Potenza RE970AS Pole Position is a pleasure to drive, with a satisfying feel in the steering wheel and good handling in dry and wet conditions. However, it falls way short of what most drivers would consider adequate in winter conditions. The Continental ExtremeContact DWS doesn't quite have the nimble feel of the others, but offers good ride quality and reasonable handling along with good overall traction regardless of the weather - dry, wet or winter.""

I found the above @: http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/testDisplay.jsp?ttid=177

Now, having lived about 20,000 miles with the Contis DWS Ultra High Performance -- in Cincinnati's climate -- I would not hesitate to ""go again"" with the Contis.

If I lived perhaps 100 miles or so due south of Cincinnati, the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3's would certainly vie for my dollars.

The further north I might live, however, the Conti DWS UHP's would still be the ones to beat based on the Tire Rack review. The review does tend to make me think the DWS's are much more of a compromise than anything else, but they are much stiffer than the standard GT Contis that came with my S4, very quiet and they do improve the handling of the car as noted in my post regarding air pressure and tires.

It would appear that the Michelin's are the new standard in UHP all seasons, but the review seems to suggest they are not as all year round good as the Continentals.

It's great to have such excellent choices."

1934,markcincinnati,November 2014,"sween and roadb -- you two are doing it the way that it really SHOULD be done. I assume I am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires. I admit the solution you two have chosen is superior.

My original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a city that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.

Were I a resident of, say, Minnesota or North Dakota or perhaps even Michigan, I may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.

Were I the type to really push my car (S or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer MAX Performance tires (my 2009 A4 did come with MAX performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).

I like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, I assume, most US drivers. I have a car that allows me to be a better driver than I probably am (in real life); I have been to 4 Audi driving schools in Austria, one Porsche school in little ol' Dayton, Ohio and a BMW X-drive school in South (and North) Carolina.

I have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, I find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers foist upon Americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.

I am lobbying the manufacturers (Audi in my case) to consider stepping up to UHP A/S's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rubber most manufacturers shod their cars with when the customer orders ""non-Summer"" tires.

I take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.

For those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all I am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to UHP A/S;s rather than not even know what you're missing.

You two, indeed, drive it like you live. I applaud your behavior but I'm still OK with mine.

You might say, and I do, that good is the enemy of great. In this case, I'll say what I am looking for is to graduate from good to very good -- which still remains the enemy of greatness, but in this instance, I, for one, am willing to live with it."
1935,sweendogy,November 2014,"Now in my second swap out and mark I agree it's not the best- I don't know the perfect date to do the swap- don't want to wait to long and hit a patch of ice on slicks or drive to long on the harder winters in decent mild weather. The cost to swap is not cheap when also buying another set of rims along with the cost of tires. The goodyear a/s UHP I had on the G - they did the trick just fine. They def rode a little harsher then the standard G tires and were better in the sun- but the G on the old set (when new) was better in the snow with the standard non UHP - a/s. No perfect answer in this equation, unless you move to either Arizona or Alaska. I would go to Zona."

Here goes:
=====

I'll stick with the A3 & A4 to introduce a new forum class for ""LPS"" [suffix'd] cars.

For the moment, let's say the ELLPS class is solidly where the new A3 belongs, To me, that seems to suggest the A4 (and the 2016 A4 leaps to mind) is no longer an ELLPS, nor is it an LPS, since the A6 is the representative of the LPS entry from Audi.

Well, two LPS classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. And, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.

Audi and BMW (and Mercedes too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.

And, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. The BMW 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. The current A4 used to be the size of the new A3 -- and when the current A4 was introduced in the US as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current A6. I know, I had a 2005 A6 that I kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that I could move to the new A4 and not have any period of time where I was not in an Audi. When the 2009 A4 came in to the dealer, I pulled my A6 up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.

The A4 got big! Then, when the new gen A6 came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the A3 was in the pipeline (not the 2009 A3, which was essentially a VW) and what we have in the brand new A3 is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the A4 into what used to be the size class of the A6, Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lexus.

We now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for cars to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) LPS cars. ELLPS, ILLPS & LPS is my proposal.

ILLPS means Intermediate Level LPS also known as a member of the phylum: Luxoperforiososedantis.

So, assuming we all accept the notion that three LPS classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) A4, 3 series and C class (while were sticking with the Germans) to the ILLPS forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ELLPS board (forum) for cars like the new Audi A3, BMW 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as I know) and the Mercedes CLA (which is a 4-door coupe, according to MB). We move the CTS firmly to the LPS forum and put the ATS in with the ILPS cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ELLPS class.

I would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.

Which brings me to perception.

I cannot -- YET -- place the Hyundai Genesis (for example) in the mix of LPS anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum's class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. I would assume the Genesis will be an LPS member someday.

Perhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum Luxoperforiososedantis.

In any case, the time has come for the current ELLPS suspects to move to the ILLPS forum.

At least I think so."

Test drive a BMW 550i, Since BMW really doesn't have a car to directly compete with the S6, some would say a 535 would be close, but I think a 550i is closer, but the BMW would be faster. For 75K you get a car faster with roughly the same equipment.

A base Macan at that...

A base Macan is comparably equipped to an SQ5.. Similar 340 HP turbo-six engines.. But, good luck finding any Porsche without $15K of options..

That's correct. SQ5 is supercharged, Macan is turbocharged.

1973,sweendogy,November 2014,"@flightnurse‌ the s6 has a 8 not a 6- and it's twin turboed - FYI
- 2015 they made it better- check it out below

http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2016-audi-s6-first-drive-review"
1974,markcincinnati,November 2014,"Some quick (for me) follow ups:

Equipped pretty much to the max, the SQ5 (Prestige) will be in the $60's. A ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly Porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10K more. My Audi dealer says the Porsche will be almost $15K more ""similarly"" loaded.

I don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the Macan S can easily go well into the $70's and the Macan Turbo can pass $100K -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the S and the SQ5.

The US SQ5 is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the Macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.

Those who want more headroom, too, will consider the SQ5 since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. I thought the two cars were redundant, and I can still convince myself of that, but I can also see the Macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the Macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a Cayenne.

I'd test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.

The SQ5 does have more HP and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the Macan's 7-spd PDK.

Both are very fine examples of excess -- in a CUV suit. We have 25,000 miles on our SQ5 -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the Audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.

The S6, at its price, doesn't seem to have an analog from the other Germans. The BMW 535 doesn't even come close and the 550 isn't as sticky as the S6 (thanks to quattro).

I can't really call the S6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the MSRP than the BMW. I'd avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.

I floored the S6 and counted to 3 -- when I looked down I had gone beyond 100MPH from about 60. Nothing I've driven (other than a Corvette) even comes a little bit close.

The S6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my S4 seems a bit too small -- so I look forward to a larger S4, although the S6 is my ""lust for"" car.

The least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the SQ5 -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure. Too bad the Macan is likely to steal the show, being that it is, after all, a Porsche."
1975,brian125,November 2014,"When I was at the Audi dealership I was talking to a guy getting a oil change on his SQ5. Absolutely loves this vehicle. Claims the ride and handling is phenomenal. price tag was up there thou. Didn't actually see one there.

I find the S6 a little smaller inside for me. At 6'1 with 2 back surgery's under my belt and weighting closer to a quarter pounder with cheese area these days Car size, getting in and out is priority. In a perfect world I would love the S8 interior dimensions in the size of a S-6 but with a S6 price tag. That being said my dilemma which probably is not a bad one is replacing my 13, R-spec Genesis for a S6, or trading my 2012, BMW X-5 with 30k miles and buying the Q-7.

I originally went to dealership to test drive the Q7 and wound up driving a 2015, S-6. I Love this vehicle or lust for it............ maybe both.. This car is the total package. So I'm either going for 2 shots in the ribs for a Hyundai trade in or 1 hard slap in the face for the X-5. I'm hoping my golf buddy takes my X-5 off my hands. Then my decision will be a lot easier.

Such problems around the holidays for us car lovers. Probably why strokes are up holiday time.
23 Telluride SX-P X-Line, 23 Camry XSE"
1976,markcincinnati,December 2014,"Long (food-centric) holiday weekends are for cooking, dining out (and over eating), going to places in your city you haven’t been to for years, movies, more movies . . . and test driving new cars (regardless of the possibility you would ever buy one).

The following list of – hopefully descriptive – terms, apply to the latter activity, or better said apply as descriptive terms of the test-driven car, this past Friday (the day after the food coma).

Clarification of the terms, that is how they may be applied, is noted (in parentheses):

-Aroused (you don’t start this car, you press the button on the console and it is “aroused”)

-Audacious

-Bland-looking (dashboard)

-Brutish

-Close (front seat)

-Cramped (back seat)

-Crude-ish

-Dart-y

-Expensive (unfortunately, equipped as it apparently needs to be equipped, it is easily 10-15% too much money for a car that has luxury intentions but doesn’t deliver much luxury despite its long list of features)

-Fast (as in, “How fast would you like to go sir, I can manage 150 if that would be sufficient.”)

-Firm (harsh-es kinder gentler side; this car is capable of firm only on the smoothest of road surfaces and/or above 85MPH)

-Fun (to drive for relatively short distances)

-Harsh (on secondary roads you are punished over every patched pot-hole you drive over, pounded by every expansion joint you meet and slammed when you drive over the various undulations presented by our aging highway infrastructure)

-Jittery (think hum while strumming your lips)

-Loud (road noise, wind noise is minimal)

-Minimalist (the large expanse of black plastic on the section of the dash in front of the passenger isn’t exactly cheap looking, no, it’s not that, it just looks boring, unimaginative, perhaps like there is some carbon fiber or brushed aluminum trim piece that was accidentally omitted)

-Nervous (the car, not me)

-Nimble (turns like a go-kart)

-Noisy (not much isolation from the engine or the road – makes conversation at speed require LOUD TONES even for the two front-seat passengers; I could imagine it would require yelling for back-seat passengers to hear or to be heard)

-Powerful (not quite OMG, but very much like a two-year old V8 Mustang, in fine tune)

-Precise (I imagine it feels like a Swiss watch, if you could actually drive one, that is)

-Punishing (see harsh above, but add to it a couple of kidney punches thrown in just so you don’t get the impression this car could be, in any way, considered supple)

-Quality (the feel of the switchgear is like a German chef’s knife in your hand – makes other knives (and other cars) feel just a tad bit of a lesser tool)

-Quick (dart-y could have sufficed, and “quick” is not the same as “fast” – this car is seriously quick at 0-62 in 4.7 seconds)

-Raucous (the road and tire noise would argue against a cross-country trip in this car)

-Raw (I guess I need to point out that it is also – in some ways – refined (see below), at least in terms of the power-train)

-Refined (the fit and finish are great, the doors close with nary even a hint of a tinny sound, everything is solid)

-Responsive

-Rough (you probably could have deduced this by now, but I need you to know that this only applies to the ride – the engine is like buttah)

-Sensitive (have you ever seen an old movie about a safe-cracker; you know the guy who sandpapers his fingertips before he begins turning the dial – his fingertips are sooo sensitive he can “feel” the tumblers falling into place; well, this car is sanded fingertips sensitive)

-Slick (the transmission, although “only” a six-speed, this transmission mates nicely with the smooth, powerful engine)

-Smooth (the engine)

-Solid (like a brick, you know what)

-Sonorous (the engine – ok, here’s a preliminary reveal – you would not be blamed if you thought this engine was a 6 or 8 cylinder with an old-fashioned air-sucking, honking wildly, air-intake; but you’d be wrong, this engine is the devil’s own 4-banger, avert your eyes, carry garlic cloves and cover yourself with wolfs bane just in case)

-Stiff (harsh-es kinder, gentler, cousin)

-Sublime (the seats are so good in this car they could almost make you forget its boy-racer characteristics)

-Tense (this thing is really on-edge once it is put in gear)

-Tight (jam up and jelly tight – I never knew what that meant in the song, but it seems to fit here)
[I've been told Jam up and Jelly tight is a sexual reference, so I'll let it stand]

-Tiring (again, lovely car to drive about 20 miles, maybe even 25 miles; just not the kind of thing you’d want to take long trip – even of a 100 miles – in repeatedly. . . you’d just be worn out from the, er, Sturm und Drang

-Twitchy

-Urgent

-Unyielding

-Violent

-Visceral

-Wearying (see tiring – in short this is a $50,000 go-kart; and, there is nothing wrong with that, but I think, given the car’s lack of Premium-ness, I’d go for the Subie WRX and pocket the difference).

Much to like, a bit less not to like, but overall “at these prices” you do have the choice of giving yourself kidney punches and endure about the same cacophony (maybe less, even) in the Subaru WRX.

The car in question?

A 2015 Audi S3 with the Prestige and Sport packages, plus the upgraded seats, trim and premium paint.

I so wanted to love this car – and I must compliment Audi on figuring out how to make a 4 cylinder growl and snarl -- and yes I know it is partially the work of the audio system, but who cares? (all the while being as smooth as silk) like a Mustang V8 (circa 2012) – but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short distance, just doesn’t feel like it is a Premium Class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) – it feels like what I imagine Subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current WRX's.

The Audi’s 19” wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, OK, not really) just doesn’t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50K). Getting out of an S3 and then driving off in an S4 is like night and day. The S4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that’s what makes even the “old” tech 2015 S4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the S4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.

Oh, BTW, the S3 has fantastic LED headlights – and the thing is a looker. But $50,000+? Nah.

Both would be good choices. C&D just had a nice write up about the Challenger....saying it could run with anything. But, it belies its size and weight in doing so.

The 6.4(392) SRT Challenger has some significant upgrades to the suspension- not to mention a more usable power curve. It is a bit overweight- but so is the F10 5er- and when I drive the SRT I don't feel like I'm piloting a Bavarian Town Car.

I need to do a bit more research on the NISMO; Car and Driver wrecked one at their Lightning Lap a few years ago- the brakes went MIA. Apparently the brakes get so hot that it will even boil fresh ATE DOT4 fluid. Can't have that...

The 5 so far is amazing in regards to creature comfort and driving dynamics, I use to knock the Germans but I am now slowly drifiting if I may say- an ardent fan.
You may know that my wife and I, after decades of German only, went with an Infiniti and an Acura (2011 and 2012 respectively). She kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and I kept my 36 month lease TL SH- AWD Advance 25 months.

These cars, hers an FX and mine a TL were stickered at a combined $97K. The leases had to have been subvented by the mfgrs and the cars were reliable (and I assume durable) and well made with several obvious (and successful) attempts to move them upscale from their Nissan and Honda lineage. Perhaps for the right money -- and it would have to be seriously inexpensive -- a new TL, Q or IS (I actually ordered the Lexus IS-350AWD F-Sport) might have made it into our garage.

Since we test drive cars almost as a hobby, we were really -- this time -- able to see how far the Germans had come since our last German cars, hers a 2008 BMW, mine a 2009 Audi. The differences, now, at this point of inflection are, once again in favor of the Germans.

My wife puts it this way, ""The Japanese cars are 'competent' appliances -- but they ain't got no soul."" This from a person with one undergrad and two graduate level degrees (one of them a JD) who hates it when improper grammar is used.

The hell of it is, her description is perfect -- in tone, tenor and accuracy. The Germans, today at least, have indeed again found that certain something that can best be described as soul. And, the money (when leased) is no longer an excuse to 'settle' for the more or less soul-less vehicles currently marketed by the big-3 Japanese ELLPS and LPS providers.

Frankly, even the new Volvo products bear a good long look.

Our guess is the Japanese premium cars may offer higher durability scores, but even that seems not to be the case as my wife's SQ5 Prestige now is approaching 30K miles and still feels new. We'll see if this new car smell (so to speak) remains at 50K, but things look good."
2003,flightnurse,December 2014,"Mark, we are looking at a SUV for Rick, and at the Phoenix Auto Show 2 weeks ago, it was nice to have all the SUV's in one room so to speak to take a look at them all. So far the BMW X3 and Audi Q5 are the two top contenders. At the Auto Show we looked at the MB GLA, GLK, and ML. The GL is just too big (this is Ricks words, not mine.) the GLA I was impressed with, but too small, the GLK was too small, the ML I found to be just right. What I found interesting with the ML was, the faux leather in it looked and felt real, and the contrasting stitching made the interior look more upper class. We test drove a ML250 with the new 2.1l diesel engine, I was not impressed at all with the engine, lots of turbo lag and the engine did not feel refined like the Audi or BMW. But the size was just right, slightly bigger then the Audi and BMW, but smaller then the X5 and Q7.

At the Auto show we looked at the Infiniti QX60 and was surprised on how there isn't much of a difference between the dash of the QX60 and Pathfinder, lots of Nissan switch gear in it, for almost 20K price difference between the two Nissan needs to not use parts bin parts (nissan) in the infiniti."
2004,graphicguy,December 2014,"Mark....I think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf.

I look at my former TL SH AWD and remember what the first one I drove of the current gen was like. Not sure what Acura did, but it was clear they had tweaked the suspension, updated to electronics, and numerous and sundry other things in the ensuing years up until the TLX came out. Most of what they did, you couldn't see. You could sure feel it in the way the car handled, the way it rode, the way it steered, the way the electronics responded, etc.

I have a CTS now. It iOS light years ahead of anything I've looked at recently....from the way it drives, the way it handles, the way it rides, the quality of materials, the careful assembly, the paint with lustrous, no orange peel effect, etc.

Over in the sales/purchase threads, there are lots of discussions about how much Mercedes has changed over the last 5 years. I know for a fact that the E92 BMW I had has been changed immeasurably (some say improved, some say not) vs the F3x versions.

Given your experience with the S4 vs my experience with the S4, it sounds like Audi quietly addressed their (what I considered major) issues.

The march of technology and performance in cars over the last few years is nothing short of breathtaking.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
2005,nyccarguy,December 2014,"A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS. We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet. The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.

Power train - the 3.5L V6 has remained essentially unchanged since 2006 as has the 6-Speed Automatic still found in the AWD version. The RWD has an 8-Speed automatic (maybe it can't handle the AWD?).

Adaptive Suspension - many of today's ELLPS are too soft in their base form and too harsh with their sport suspensions. The IS350 F Sport has an adaptive suspension that constantly monitors and adjusts each shock absorber.

Now back in 2006, I attended a Lexus test drive event and was able to drive an IS350 back to back with an E90 330i. Now the IS was MUCh faster (butt Dyno), but BMW took care of that in 2007 with the twin turbo 335i. I thought the BMW was a better driving car (brakes, steering, suspension). Things are different today. The BMW still puts up good numbers (328i & 335i), but they have also gotten softer and are much less engaging to drive. Maybe the playing field has evened out.

A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS. We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet. The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.

2007,markcincinnati,December 2014,"Roadburner -- you crack me up! Of course the Cheap Trick quip suggests you've been around the sun quite a few times (as have I).

Two of my friends (one is an aunt) acquired new ELLPS (1 Lexus and 1 Infiniti) cars. One of these folks (who will remain otherwise unidentified) was going from one city to another about 30 miles apart. The call to me proclaimed ""the GPS lady gives incorrect instructions"" -- and my friend ended up in a city some 60 miles in the wrong direction.

Now, I have had numerous GPS systems, my first in 2001. I have had the experience where the GPS lady did indeed provide incorrect directions (but I still arrived at my destination, just with a long detour). The last time I had a car provide wrong directions was in 2004.

The ""science"" of GPS technology and the map makers themselves have improved greatly is the point. Or perhaps the point is the GPS lady was not wrong -- and if you would have followed her directions you would not be 60 miles out of the way.

I said nothing to my friend.

I am thinking I will suggest a return visit to the dealership for a ""training class"" on the marvelous tech these Japanese cars afford. Of course, my other friend was unaware of the car's sat radio tuner and when I turned the radio to the sat band and found Classic Vinyl, my friend was amazed -- no commercials and tons of music.

Analogy: Maybe we've reached the point where CD's and iPods or iPhones (for music) are good enough and DVD-Audio despite its amazing quality, is just not worth it to most folks.

I remember, too, Sprint spent a ton of money on the sound quality of their network only to find people would rather have fewer dropouts than hi-fi sound from their cell phone network.

These cars have lots of tech, to be sure -- but other than the folks reading and writing here on Edmunds, I wonder who is actually using automatic cruise control, lane keeping, in-car Internet and even google earth (which is, at least, pretty cool to play with even if it is not really all that practical).

Have we reached some kind of saturation? Or are we all collectively waiting for ""Jarvis"" (in the Iron Man suit) to mature to the point where we don't have to learn anything to program our GPS other than to say ""I wanna go to Austin and avoid the Interstates.""

I'm back to wanting the performance of an S4 with the ride of an A8 -- that plus an upgraded sound system and I'd be fine. The current gen of GPS and the other tech is probably acceptable to folks like you and me, since we actually (apparently) take the time to learn to program it.

I'm clearly not waiting on Jarvis, but he can't get here soon enough."

BMW on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. I really don't get it, especially that C-class is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as CLA filled the entry point. There are units there well in $50K+ and still no leather. I don't know - is that plastic MB-Tex so good? I just find it hard to believe... Not to mention that not a single one?

The PLEATHER seats unlike real leather doesn't or can't breathe. Of course with modern seat ventilation technology, that may be less of an issue.

I'm still of the ""leather is better"" opinion -- but I remember ONE TIME ordering a new Audi 5000CS turbo quattro with wool seats (leather was standard and wool was a special order at no cost option). These seats, in many ways, were the most comfortable ever. Not cold in winter, not hot in summer (mine were heated, too).

The issue, with gray seats, was dirt. Well, OK, not ""dirt dirt"" but coffee, mustard, coke and other drinks, ice cream droppings and, I would imagine all sorts of other messes should one have kids in the car. A good old french fry stain would be a heart breaker.

Now, I did put sheepskin seat covers on the front buckets -- and that helped. But as good as the wool seats were, I was one and done.

I'm not against quality in-car audio systems or decent navigation systems. My issue is that today's buyers are usually distracted by the ""shiny things"" that are tangential at best to the overall driving experience.

As for crossing the center line and the lane keep feature? It would depend on the individual case, and the competence of the judge and counsel. Me, I'd probably let the defendant argue that- assuming he could prove his car had that feature.

As an aside, the judiciary has one of the highest automotive illiteracy rates of virtually any profession. A couple of judges in my district would take voluminous notes if they were hearing a case involving vehicle repairs, etc., take the case under submission, and give the notes to me so that I could sift the wheat from the chaff...

Heh... I went down that road in 2007. I had all these crates full of vinyl records I had bought from the mid-70s until I finally bought a CD player in the early '90s that were just gathering dust. My old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. And my receiver had a bad channel. So I went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. I ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s Pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. That lasted not quite a year before I lost interest. Yes, it sounds good, but I seem to have lost that desire for the one true sound that I once had. Now it is all gathering dust again.

FN....it's a long story. Reader's Digest version, I got a deal I couldn't pass up. Had a couple of hiccups, but they seem to be sorting themselves out. Cadillac is really stepping it up. CTS has turned into something I never would have expected. They're shooting at E class, 5 Series, and A6, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing.

Test drove the ATS a couple of times. That car's a blast, too. You'd like it.

Leather....I've heard the argument that Mercedes ""pleather"" is better than leather. That mostly came from their dealers. However their fake stuff may or may not wear well, I'm sure it's cheaper for them than putting leather in their cars.

Even old leather looks great. Not sure that old vinyl will look all that good down the road. I know old vinyl never smells good. To me, it's a cost cutting move by Mercedes. I can't imagine paying $50K? $60K? Maybe more, and not getting leather as part of the package.

If I were going to see any potential problem with the new TLX, it would have been with their transmissions. Acura/Honda has had a bit of a history with dicey transmissions. I really like the TLX. I hope they get that shift button thing sorted out in short fashion, and it will only take once. They are kind of on a sales roll with their vehicles right now. It would be a shame that this would bring them to a halt. If they've stopped selling the TLX, it looks like that's exactly what happened, though. I can't imagine how long it will take for then to identify the cause, come up with a fix, and get all those cars in the shops to make the fix. Hope it works out well for them.

Thanks for the professional opinion RB. I'm waiting to hear that defense in a DUI case sooner rather than later.

All the ""tex"", ""ette"" stuff is to me selling a simple fake for a price of real stuff (50 grand or more) and great legend so they can cash the profit - and charging extra if you insist on real stuff. Well, they obviously can get away with that. Especially Benz. I see BMWs have much higher percentage of real leather, but new 320 may buck the trend.

If not leather, I would rather choose premium microfiber seats (if they made), just like for a couch, as those at least would be better in hot-and-cold sweat absorption, be nicer in touch and even stronger than leather. And it doesn't pretend to be something else.

I had an 06 IS350. When I purchased it it was 2 years old...but quickly turned 3 a few months later.

Even though I had the CPO warranty I had a few items that fell outside of that coverage (which was annoying).

The biggest problem I had was after year 3 of the payments I was (still) making payments for a 5-6 year old car. So when you're nearing 5 years of payments you're paying for an 8-9 year old car. I knew all this going in...but didn't think I'd have an issue making payments on an ""old"" car.

I don't think I'd do a CPO again.

I had an 06 IS350. When I purchased it it was 2 years old...but quickly turned 3 a few months later.

Even though I had the CPO warranty I had a few items that fell outside of that coverage (which was annoying).

The biggest problem I had was after year 3 of the payments I was (still) making payments for a 5-6 year old car. So when you're nearing 5 years of payments you're paying for an 8-9 year old car.

2050,sweendogy,December 2014,The payments someone would make on a cpo would be a lot less then a new car. Yes the car would be older but the payments would significantly less and the ability to buy a better car (all in) with less cash. The financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a Cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.

I look at a CPO this way. If I am willing to go 5 years payments on a new car, I will go 3 on a 2 YO CPO. Payments end at the same age. So the only way it makes sense is if the price is lower enough to make it worthwhile, since I am giving up two years use on the car (and the best 2!)

Plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments. Though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years.

To be blunt, you simply bought a car you couldn't afford and the five-year loan simply masked that fact. Having to take a 5-year loan on nearly 3-year old car is basically an equivalent of taking a 7-year or longer loan on a new car and nobody with their right senses would do that.

Well, here are some thoughts on Infiniti -- from a former owner of an Infiniti product and also, at the same time, an Acura product.

The auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. They have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)

Infiniti decided that Q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. I would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. They had to settle for one new car, the Q50. The M37 became the Q70 as you identified.

It is true that most of us here on Edmunds know the Q70 is the former M37. I would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the Q70 is a renamed product.

The M37 and the Q70 are still very competent LPS offerings, even though the Q70 does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. To me, Infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most German-like of the Japanese (and Korean) offerings. The recent ""transfer"" of their President, Johan De Nysschen, (then late of Audi) to go to Cadillac probably is a negative for Infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since I would have assumed Johan would have made good use of his 19-year Audi stint to imbue Infiniti with even more German-ness.

Right now, it seems to me that Infiniti and Acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" The TLX could've have been the vehicle for Acura to announce ""we're not Honda anymore,"" but I think they missed the target completely if you axed me.

Meantime, Lexus has inched its way even further from Toyota and the Koreans are the ones the Germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of Japan (with the possible exception of the IS350F-sport).

Again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the Germans is the brand name ""KIA"" -- at least if you live here in River City where removing all the KIA badges seems the norm. If KIA somehow figures out a new name (think GoldStar becoming LG) for their brand, I would think the Germans might have more to worry about.

Today, the Germans seem to be the aspirational cars -- but, as the poet Frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" I did enjoy my time with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 S4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the TL was about as close to an S4 as one could get for about $47K.)

Power from that 5.0-liter V-8 is down from the 2014 model's 429 hp at 6400 rpm to 420 hp at 6000 rpm, but torque is up. The Genesis V-8 now produces 383 lb-ft at 5000 rpm, up from the 2014 model's 376 lb-ft at 5000 rpm. The Genesis V-8 is happy to sip regular fuel instead of premium, but then it only makes 407 hp and 372 lb-ft.
The new Genesis is a more substantial car, and the weight has a predictable effect at the track. Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph comes in 5.2 seconds, up from that last-gen Genesis' 4.8-second time. That makes the 2015 Genesis V-8 a midpack performer, depending on what you think its competitors are. Smaller, pricier V-8-powered competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz E550 and Infiniti Q70 5.6 will smoke the Genesis V-8. Among price-competitive offerings, an all-wheel-drive 2012 Audi A6 with a supercharged V-6 engine sprinted from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, while a 2012 BMW 535i checked in at 5.5 seconds, an all-wheel-drive 2014 Mercedes-Benz E350 at 5.8 seconds, and a 2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport with a six-speed automatic at 5.4 seconds. Passing power from 45-65 mph is ample in the Genesis V-8, with a 2.6-second time not appreciably different from that of the last-gen Genesis V-8 (2.4 seconds), A6 3.0T (2.5 seconds), and 2013 GS 350 F Sport (2.6 seconds), but quicker than the 535i's 2.9 seconds and the 2014 CTS 3.6's 3.1 seconds."

I have the 2013 R-spec sedan. I'm very impressed with ride, quality of this vehicle. Nothing but high praise. Handling is not in the Audi or BMW category but that's not why I bought this vehicle. The Genesis is very big inside , ultra quiet on the road , One of the best sounding radio systems ( lexicon ) 17 speakers in any car I heard. Plenty of giddy up when you want to live life fast @429 h/p A good bang for your buck. CR reports / C&D and most reviewers have put the new 2015 model at the top of the pack . A real good buy for your money if you could get past the brand.

I test drove the 2015 Genesis v-6.. This luxury sedan @48k is a great choice that offers amenities that European vehicles are selling 15, to 20k more. The Upgraded suspension modes , Handling, Refinement is well noted on this 2015 model . Add Hyundai's 5/60....100k powertrain warranty makes this vehicle quite appealing .

My local BMW dealer is offering $272/mo on a lease of a 320ix ... $40K MSRP and $2500 down (I suspect some of that is for the acquisition fee, but still...). Lot of car for the money.

Yes, really. When I first drove an F10 535i the only thought that came to mind was ""Old man's car."" My wife later got stuck with an F10 loaner; she drove it home, got out and announced ""It's nothing but a big soft boat. I HATE it!""

The maintenance plan has changed, with the current plan you only get ONE free service a year, or unless the on board computer says differently. BMW uses synthetic oil and allows BMW to get away with the longer service intervals. The real start of the maintenance plan is the 4yr-50K bumper to bumper warranty., So if you drive aggressively you can go through a set of brakes in the 50K and save yourself about $1200...

When I driving between Phoenix and San Diego the beginning of the year (weekly) I racked up a lot of miles, but the service indicator in the car kept the same date for when the car will need service, but in June I brought the car into the dealer to get the oil changed since I had 13K miles on the car, cost, $110... An expensive lesson... But back in Oct I took the 320 in for it's first free service, they did everything and changed the oil, for free... My service indicator says my next service is due in 1400 miles on 4-15-2015, I currently have 21500 miles on it. So not too sure what to make of the service indicator.. The maintenance plan is nice, but I think BMW needs to shorten the intervals in which they give the free service.

Oh lord, BMW is a car company in which it needs to make money, so they build cars that majority of people would buy. If BMW would go back and build just niche cars they wouldn't be making any money, because people like you Road don't buy enough cars to keep BMW open. Yes, todays 3 series, 5 series are bigger cars, just like the Mazda 6, Camry, A4, and C class are bigger then their last generation.

So does my F30 have the road feel that my E46 330 had NO, so is the F30 a horrible car no. It does what I want it to do, the standard suspension is much firmer then say the Nissan Altima, Camry, Accord and a dozen of other cars and it still drives like a German car. The road feel isn't an issue for me, and why, simple, I don't drive like an A55 all over town, when driven normal I don't have a problem with it. I wanted a M235, until I drove one for 3 days and saw that it is just too small for me, I have grown to like the bigger size of the F30.

BMW has not done much, if anything, because it ""needs"" to make money. It is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, I know, but I think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit. They were when they made the versions of cars that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.

The perspective that I hold currently is that BMW is actually making cars they have evidence their customers want. They have ""proof"" that their new cars are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof. If the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the cars until the cars ""succeed.""

A key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by BMW, to name just one) is the customers (BMW is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available.

Said another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- according to the market BMW caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. That is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured). If you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion. The facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. Now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that BMW values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.

I believe I have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.

Likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying cars with 6's and 4's. The market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.

I do not believe that ALL new BMW's or Mercedes or Audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are.

I applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- I am often sentimental; the older I get the more I represent that remark, in fact. But nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past. BMW (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new cars to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.

Auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.

You may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.

Now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow Luddite, I did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission. However, now that I have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an Audi 7-speed DSG connected to a super-charged 6, I must finally admit Eli Whitney had a pretty good idea after all.

Dammit!"
2115,roadburner,December 2014,"I don't think the enthusiasts are actually clamoring for simply a remanufactured 2002; what they want is a car that continues to embody the traditional BMW virtues- a nimble car that communicates what it is doing to the driver. Cadillac and Lexus are actually moving into that automotive niche while BMW abandons it. Pandering to the status-conscious ""wearers"" who want a featherbed ride and minimum involvement in the driving process may generate short-term gains, but those folks will move on to the next shiny ""in"" bauble in a heartbeat.

2116,cdnpinhead,December 2014,"The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties).

I fail to see why EPA/CARB-driven cars are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the U.S. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum. If BMW sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the U.S. I'd already be driving one.

Oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the West, I'd be interested in their reasoning. Driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire. Then there's the question of whether the tire machine at Ed's Gas, Bait and Whorehouse in Austin, NV, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.

It's clear that the majority, as dictated to by various governments, have given us the selection of vehicles that are available. I choose not to participate, and I don't think I'm alone. The majority on here seem to think it's wonderful. Party on.

2118,markcincinnati,December 2014,"The cars that are sold here in the US at least are here because of the customers, not the government. The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat. The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.

Overwhelmingly, the reason the cars from BMW are they way they are is because these cars sell -- if manual transmission diesel Bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the US (assuming they are actually manufactured).

In the universe that I am familiar with, I know that Audi of America responded to a LOUD, but very very tiny campaign (that I participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the A6. Audi went ahead and made the A6 manual trans version available to US customers. The cars sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the cars for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months.

I did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""Last DJ"") Audi of size in 2003. It was an allroad and I had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans A6's to an unmoved and ""I'll take my business elsewhere"" market.

The last BMW I drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including X-drive and all of the stuff BMW deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like. The car was quick, fast, quiet, comfortable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).

One of the folks I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.

The car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market. We may, or some of us may, deride the newer cars as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with BMW, the new cars are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).

I wouldn't mind ordering the car just the way I wanted it, if I could, but only a handful of the variants are available over here, and none are the ones I'm interested in. I think they've finally got oil level indicators that work, unlike the ones that were first introduced to replace the stone-simple dipstick. I'm told one of the reasons was the oil vapor that escaped from the open dipstick tube. I could change out the solid-rubber-feeling run-flats but there's no point with what's available here.
Wow! That's variety. My question is this: would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US? And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US. My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.

Of course I said my assumption -- is there any reason to think there IS a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?

While I am at asking [hypothetical] questions, I am wondering why I've never seen an Audi or BMW (or any other brand, perhaps excluding Porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. Both my wife and I had to order red leather in our 2014 Audi S cars -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.

I assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of Audis and BMWs) do seem to support that notion.

One more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, I assume)? I read the comment that new BMWs appeal to customers who want to wear their cars -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned)."

I'd consider a 320i if the steering was decent- I just can't accept a setup that is so devoid of feel- in a BMW, at any rate.

2124,graphicguy,December 2014,"Sorry FN....just saw your question. Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.

I got the CTS AWD Performance version. The Magnetic Ride suspension is the real deal. Allegedly, the MRC is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions. It has its own version of torque vectoring. These ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the Audi S and TL SH AWD).

It smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating. Like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available. I keep it in ""Sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering I've used) and changes shift patterns. Feels much like a RWD based Audi Quattro or TL SH AWD.

Put it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic E class or an A6 Quattro.

Sport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn't describe the ride accurately,

Great seats, while not the sport seats in the TL SH AWD (which I loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat Mercedes seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the S4's.

Not as speedy as an Audi S4, but quite torquey. Probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. Probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the TL....especially around town. It gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.

All the gee gaws. It took a few days to get used to CUE. But, now that I am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. Touch controls work. Instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. You slide just above the metal bars.

All the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. Build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.

For reasons that befuddle me (and probably Cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the CTS. I got into one for about the price of a middle of the road A4, TL, 3 series.....a screaming bargain, that according to their management, will be the last time those deals will be available for the same car.

Yes, it's new. Yes, I'm enamored with it. Pretty darn happy with a car that's made in Detroit that's able to match, and in some important ways, excel over the E, A6, etc out there.

RB...you're a track guy. I admire you as your interest in track work isn't just superficial (vs some people I know who trick out their autox cars and like their car's decals more than their cars).

I did some autox years ago (in a Toyota Corolla 16V), but I was mostly a 1/4 mile, dragstrip guy....had my own rat rod for that very purpose.

Some people (including myself) just want a good handling car that can get out of its own way and offers some creature comforts.

The majority want a 3 pointed star, or a roundel. Their car hunt begins and ends there.

stick....I view the 320i to be a spiritual successor to the 2002. Having been in one of the original 2002s (not mine, but a college friend's), they broke the mold. BMW has built on that success. They are where they are today as a result of the 2002's initial success.

GC BMW wants the M235i to be the 2002 successor, which I don't think it correct, I agree with you though that the 320 is more the successor. getting the 320 with the sport package and Manuel transmission is a great way to get a RWD sports sedan, no other manufacture offers this layout. Many people don't care about leather interior, or power side mirror, you can also code in options that aren't offered on a 320 to enhance the 320."
2129,graphicguy,December 2014,"Billy...I really had no good reason to explain why I got rid of the TL SH AWD. Great cars....all the TL's I've had.

Long and short of it, through a friend of a friend, I met the owner (and his son) of a Caddy dealer that my late Mother did business with. I had relayed the terrible experience my late Mother had with the dealership about 10 years ago (one that I had to get involved with to work it out). He explained that the entire staff had turned over since then, and that he was not aware of my Mother's issues. He invited me to just come in and meet his son, who had just been named the GM of the dealership and to see how they had totally refurbished the physical building.

I'm a car guy. I was curious. Went there. Got a tour of the newly remodelled dealership. Was invited to take a car home over the weekend. Really was enamored with the way the CTS drove and how well it was built. I essentially got a $60K car less $15K+ and, over two years of ownership, I only lost $6K on the TL. Thought it was a good deal.

Rest is history.

2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
2130,sweendogy,December 2014,@graphicguy - can you go over those numbers again with this trade - / hard to believe you got 15k off a new car and then at the same time were able to trade the TL in for 6k less then paid after 2 years- (did you also get 6k off when buying the TL originally? I have done a few car deals in my day but this tops the cake.
2131,graphicguy,December 2014,"Sween...paid $38 and change for the TL. Caddy dealer gave $32. Figure he'll ask 34, sell for 33.

CTS is a '14....C&D Top 10. Caddy can't sell them. Don't know why. It's as nice of a car as I've ever driven. Caddy slapped a $6K rebate on them. I figure there's another $5K in hidden trunk money. Dealer sells at cost, moves a unit, gets closer to 2014 GM unit bonus.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
2132,circlew,December 2014,"CTS is a '14....C&D Top 10. Caddy can't sell them. Don't know why.
And to be fair, the new CTS is priced right in line with the cars that GM sees as its key competitors: the Mercedes-Benz E Class, the BMW 5-Series, and Audi's A6.

But Cadillac's customers aren't used to paying those kinds of prices, and some are shopping elsewhere. Meanwhile, BMW and Mercedes buyers aren't (yet) flocking to Cadillac's showrooms to make up the difference.

In other words, Cadillac is losing its old customers -- but isn't yet winning enough new ones to make up the difference. So, why isn't Cadillac trimming its prices?

Not long ago, a price cut would have been GM's response. But these days, Cadillac is under new management -- and its new president, longtime Audi executive Johan de Nysschen, ordered something different: a big cut in production at the factory that makes the two sedans."
2133,graphicguy,December 2014,"circle....good points. I think Cadillac is going through a transition. Not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to Benz or Audi or BMW. My dealer says he sells every $85K Escalade he can get his hands on....at MSRP plus. Cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two. What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6.

CTS moved up the ladder, with the ATS going against the cars we talk about in here.

Their President even admitted this isn't going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.

Cadillac is in a unique situation where they don't seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. I don't know if they ever would have snagged me unless the CTS were such a very good car to begin with.

You'll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the CTS and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way I'll spend $7K more for the new one over the old one."" Cadillac points them in the direction of the ATS and says....here's a better car than your previous CTS and it costs less. Some will get that. Some won't.

However, if you want an even better car than the ATS, here's the CTS.

Again, it will take some time. And, some won't even like the way the new ATS or CTS drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.

But, once they take hold, I think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and excel in both spaces.

They seem determined to do what it takes to get there. Good cars. Drive an ATS or CTS if you get a chance. They are very good sport luxury cars....almost getting to the point where tehy are filling the voids that Mercedes and BMW have abandoned.

Losing $6K depreciation on the CTS probably isn't in the cards. But, I bought it right. So, it will all even out.

I'm one of the few who actually liked the TL's styling. But, I realize I was in the minority. Good cars, especially for the money.

CTS is a different level of car. The CTS' turbo 2.0L performs better than the TL with the 3.7L 6 cylinder. 50-50 weight distribution which makes for great CTS handling.

In short, it looks better, handles better, performs better, is build better with better materials than my TL. That said, the CTS costs thousands more, too. So, it better be that much better than the TL.

In the honeymoon phase with it. If it stays out of the dealership service dept, I'll be a happy camper.

I used to tell my sales staff that high sales volume at low margins does not mean they're good at their jobs. High margins coupled with high volumes were the keys to success.

Exactly. All these things are cyclical. Look at the reliability/warranty issues that Audi and BMW seem to experience. I would be shocked if Cadillac wasn't far superior. I tell you, if anyone drives an ATS like mine for any length of time, they are going to be won over.

My issue is with the SD card slot. It's conveniently located right next to the volume knob on the center dash of the ""radio."" You can buy an SD card (16 GB for about $12 these days), so plenty of space for FLAC files. The other problem is the manual says it supports up to 320 bit rates and it seems not to.

2162,markcincinnati,January 2015,"I'm now at 22,000 miles on my '14 S4 -- the car, in every way has been flawless. Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal."" The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile. However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless). Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers.

I had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""Internet Destination, Morton's of Chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and THEN entering it into the sat nav.

The thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the TV commercials claim (for SW Ohio) 4, 4G LTE lines (family promo) for $100/mo.

Of course, were I to buy a new A3, Audi Connect no longer uses T-Mobile.

I'd pay $10/month for this crappy (T-Mobile) service -- but $30 for 2G? No way.

The concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3G) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location). Swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""

For those folks who want driving performance, I can assure you the S4 (with the 7-speed DSG) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won't do without breaking a sweat. Another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.

Obviously, I am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong T-Mobile reception areas probably can't relate to. But in terms of reliability and ""tightness"" this S4 is as new-feeling at 22K miles as it was with 22 miles.

That's the story so far."

That is ONE big HUGE ""IF!"" I hope you have better luck with it. Anxious to hear how it holds up, so try to drive it a lot just for the fun of it and rack up those miles!

My fear would be even if it doesn't need tow trucks on a yearly basis, it might develop rattles and other nuisances I just haven't had with my German and Japanese cars.

I'd also worry that dealer would turn on you again if things went south quickly (show their true colors again).

Lastly, since I've been hit driving a new car recently, I'd worry about the plummeting value of the car (resale) because insurance companies are happy to take advantage and low ball offers.

Wow the coverage on caddy is unreal- good for the customers who are going that way.

I'm trying to put a finger on why I have not driven/looked at one- recall concerns seem like a cop out, no one I know owns them-
I dragged myself to a Caddy dealer to drive one for the first time before easily deciding to get the (ordered from Germany in August 2013) S4 for more bang for my buck. I drove the ATS 2.0T and 3.6. The high sticker shock was tremendous and a first strike. A minor imperfection in the roadway unsettling the car and suspension was strike 2, and I just didn't feel the in the pants OOMPH from the butt Dyno I wanted to feel. I may have to start driving used broken-in cars with some miles on them already because I think programming is making some of these new cars feel sluggish on test drives due to perhaps ""built-in"" breaking-in programming?

well, Caddy has really stepped up on peace of mind. 4yr/50k bumper-to-bumper, 4yr/50k included maintenance, and 6yr/70k power train. Is there a better standard coverage offering in the lux market?
When did GM end the across the board 5 yr./100K miles Power Train Warranty? That was better, though only marginally than the 6 yr./70. I remember they even extended that old 100K warranty to SAAB.

I wasn't frightened at one point of the reliability of my mid-90's Dodge either. I figured by the mid-nineties Americans had figured out how to make a halfway decently reliable car. Didn't stop it from being a lemon though.



'15 Audi Misano Red Pearl S4, '16 Audi TTS Daytona Gray Pearl, Wife's '19 VW Tiguan SEL 4-Motion"
2169,markcincinnati,January 2015,"Reliable and Durable:

I am not a good ambassador of/for the durability of [Audi's in particular] German cars -- since the highest mileage I've ever put on one was just south of 67,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6 3.2). However, my Audis (and we've had dozens of them) have always been very reliable (excluding our 1978 Audi 5000 which did die young, or at least the battery died young). We never had what I would call a catastrophic failure of the drive train in any of them, period.

Moreover, I suspect our 2011 Infiniti FX35 would have ""run perfectly"" until the wheels turned square and the pistons fell apart -- but we only kept it until it had some 55,000 miles on the OD, so again, who knows -- it, like our Audis was totally reliable. And then:Our 2012 Acura SH-AWD seemed like a budget Audi S4 (a good thing), but it certainly felt both flimsy and tinny (even the doors closed with wimpy thud). And the brakes had about one good stop in them from speed before they faded; and, the rotors almost always felt warped -- even though much of that turned out to be three bent wheels (that Acura paid 50% of the cost of replacement). Three bent wheels? Even if I was abusive while driving, I still find it hard to believe there were 3 bent wheels -- and that the original dealer never thought to road-force balance the wheels to see if THAT was the reason the brakes always appeared to chatter and rumble so.

I have to assume the new ATS and CTS (I did drive the latter) are very fine cars -- my in-laws were Cadillac people, but their experiences were with much older models (pre-2007) and during those [dark] years, their Cadillacs could hardly drive past the dealership without needing to go in to remedy some malady or another.

Cars of all ilks, today, I must assume are very reliable and probably durable, too. I am thinking that based on the way my wife puts miles on her SQ5, we may want to trade it in after about 36-42 months due to the ""depreciation"" hit that happens at about 100,000 miles, not due to any serious ""durability"" or reliability issues.

I can't remember where I read (or heard, perhaps) that virtually all ""modern"" cars will be essentially trouble free (not necessarily low maintenance, though) for a minimum of 150,000 miles. One of the folks I work with has a Bimmer (530) with over 170,000 miles on it and has never had any major repairs, only the maintenance required by the book. He's had dents and dings aplenty (and had them all fixed), but nothing major, ever.

My friend says he puts about $500 in the car two or three times per year -- and everything works pretty much the same as it did when he bought the thing new in 2004.

I'm a fan of the ""factory"" sponsored extended mntce and warranty programs -- and in my case, since my car is leased, I can have the car CPO'd to 100,000 miles for about $1,500 as long as I do so under 50,000 miles and have proof I've maintained the scheduled mntce requirements.

I keep thinking this S4 is so good it will be a keeper -- at least so long as at least one of our cars has the latest and greatest technology. That's the drawback -- as each new gen of these cars comes out they add or update some ""gotta have"" feature or tech (yeah, ""gotta have"" for me, that is). My friend who is part owner of an airplane says he just keeps upgrading his decades old plane with the newest and greatest tech and rebuilds the engine so that despite its age, his plane is actually kept completely up to date. Makes me wish at least some of that approach would trickle down to automobiles.

First thing I'd do is swap out that T-Mobile Internet connection module/radio. Why can't there just be a jack that allows the car to ""sniff"" the Internet from my iPhone. I know, follow the money.

In conclusion, congratulations and kudos to those of you getting new Cadillacs and frankly just about anything new that might qualify today as an ELLPS or LPS car. I wonder, too, at the price point, if the new Genesis is yet a candidate for either ""class"" [of car] -- I've looked at them and they are seriously -- almost Audi A6 -- nice. Yet they're priced like an A4.

Happy New Year."

2171,graphicguy,January 2015,"Mark....well said. I think all manufacturers, but particularly the American marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's history.

It used to be Honda or Toyota were the brands you bought for reliability. Not so sure you can make a significant case for that any more. Aside from Land Rover and Smart, who iare notoriously troublesome, one should expect a long, durable life from all of today's cars.

Technology in cars is moving at break neck speed. You mentioned having your car become a wifi hot spot. Who would have thought of that even 5 short years ago?

In these classes of cars, in addition to great motors and transmissions, suspensions become much more sophosticated. I know in the CTS, I'm amazed at how smooth the suspension is on the interstate, and at the same time can carve up some backroads with equal sophistication.

With the torque vectoring you find in your S4, and what I had in my TL SH AWD, Cadillac has their own version of it, allowing rotation and curve hugging that borders on the unbelievable.

Even the materials in cars of this class are first rate. While both my Audi and TL had pleasant materials, Cadillac is using real wood, real aluminum, real chrome, real suede, controls work like they are bathed in butter or have a tactile feel that really begins to define what the marketers are striving for.....a high end, high quality look ad feel.

Aside from some of the foibles we have had with our cars (mostly along the lines of dealers and/or manufacturers not listening to our complaints), our cars are at the height of car making right now....again, especially in this class.

Stick...all good points. I don't think I worry as much about things going awry because it's rare that I keep a car outside the warranty term. I can't imagine what the cost would be to replace something like iDrive, MMI, CUE, etc. Then again, so much of it is software based, maybe they just download firmware.

As it stands, I can control my iPhone through CUE (Siri eyes) now. Is it a big jump to think that the electronics on our cars will be controlled entirely by our smart devices? I have the Magnetic Ride Control on the CTS. Is it far fetched to theink that Cadillac can change the algorithm to how it respoinds via a software download via your phone? How about changing how your steering responds via download, given that most are electronic steering systems today?

Cadillac could change the entier look of CUE and the way it fhnctions with a download. But, you have to have that starting point in order to do that.

Will that make cars more or less reliable as a result? These are all hypotheticals, but it doesn't take too big of a leap of faith to see where this could go.

I still like the Challenger R/T and SRT,; big as they are they are pretty quick(well, the SRT is, at least) and just entertaining and involving in a way that most of the other cars I've looked at just aren't.
I want to like the BRZ/FR-S but I just can't. Not appreciably quicker than my Club Sport with no other redeeming qualities.
The Mustang? I looked at an Ecoboost, but really, a ponycar without a V8 is like the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue without Kathy Ireland(that dates me, I realize). As for the V8, yes, it's fast and handles well, but again, it lacks that ""Gotta Have It!"" vibe I need to keep a sled long term.
The Challenger is big and brash and unashamedly retro in an intriguing way- and with the SRT notching up a 1/4 mile time in the high 12 second range along with decent handling and braking, I could enjoy it for some time. If I'm going to have numb steering I want some other facets of the car to entertain me- and the F30 3ers just don't excite me at all- even my lowly MS3 can show a clean pair of heels to a 335i these days...

So, yes, if you drive the vehicle to its potential (where you are actually utilizing that extra power), you will burn more fuel. So that is one reason. As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. So sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation.

1. An additional revenue stream
2.

This factory option, then is probably a win for all, in short.

I look at what APR and others have done for the current S4 and even RS7 Audis -- and I'm tempted. But, then, I also know the risk of running naked, without a warranty -- and I think, nah baby nah.

I at least like the concept and notion that my S4 will be both reliable (not too much of a stretch for any car, these days) AND durable (that's the $64,000 or in my case $57,000 question.)

My modifications to the MS3 have been ridiculously cheap. I spent just $545 for a new Mazdaspeed intake and $230 for a used Hypertech tuner- which pumped up the motor to 310 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. A stronger/stiffer rear motor mount from the Focus ST was a whopping $59.97.

The suspension work set me back $1780- but that number includes an adjustable rear anti-roll bar with billet mounts, Koni FSDs with new strut mounts, strut bearings, and bump stops, and a set of OEM take-offs for my summer tires(Michelin Pilot Super Sports which I won for being a Street Survival coach).

So, for just $2,345 I have a car that keeps me entertained until I can find a RWD toy that is actually close to fast(0-100 in 10.5 seconds or less, VIR lap time of no more than 3.10 seconds).

To me, this vacation sounds like a much better use of money.  More than just you can enjoy a vacation.  So, kudos to you for this.  Unless you have money to burn (which I never have had), track stuff seems pretty selfish to me.  There is not much in life I enjoy more than a good vacation.  YMMV, as always.

Yeah, I have absolutely no intention of tuning my caddy. The only time I would ever see the results would be at the track, so its just not worth it.
I finally got to track my big heavy S4 and my only complaints don't involve power; there was plenty of that. The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads. I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too). I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power. Went with the Hawk blue box HPS pads, as I'm told the OEM S4 pads are designed for A4's and their typical drivers, in frozen weather for the NE USA. Not for warm Southern CA tracks. Shame on me for assuming S4's had better brake pads than A4's.

So my brake pads killed my rotors at 15K miles. Lesson learned. Also got better Motul 600 brake fluid.

2193,qbrozen,January 2015,"I did exactly that setup on my 135i and ate through the pads in one 2-day HPDE. The stock pads, in comparison, lasted me 2 such events and still had life left in them.

2194,andres3,January 2015,"If I recall, the 135i weight advantage over the 335i is fairly small right? If I would have skipped the last 2 sessions I wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs. The tracks are a long drive from San Diego and I track only 2 weekends (max) per year, so I had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary.

One fun thing is I had a full brake fluid reservoir and was able to pull enough G force on some turns that my ""BRAKE"" light indicator would come on briefly. Annoying multiple chimes with it though. Eventually I was able to figure out the G forces were making the fluid move enough that it triggered the low fluid sensor. I added a little bit and that solved the problem for most of the weekend.

2195,qbrozen,January 2015,"My challenge, and why I tried different fluids and pads, was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps. Took me a couple HPDEs, but I finally figured out what the problem was. The TCS on that car had 3 settings. On; 1 push to turn off the TCS but leave on stability control; and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off. The middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand. Well, after new fluid and pads didn't fix it, I realized that every time I would touch the curbing, it was trying to use the active rear diff (which involves braking one rear tire on that car) to ""straighten"" me out. I finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off. It pulled out of the turns better since it wasn't holding me back anymore, and the pedal no longer went soft. Huge difference.

2200,benjaminh,January 2015,"Acura's ILX, up until this point, has been almost a joke because of the lackluster 2.0 engine. But the new ILX is going to get standard the direct-injected 2.4 liter with the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter from the larger TLX. The TLX 2.4 was tested by Motor Trend with a 0-60 time of 7.2. But since the ILX will almost certainly weigh about 500 pounds less, I'm thinking that the new ILX will really be quite a performer for the price. It's expected to start at c. $28k msrp.

Yeah....that's a lot of time to pass. I hear that BMW is revamping all of their drivetrains in that time. Audi's current A/S/4s are getting long in the tooth (although, one could make a case that at least the S4 is still running with the pack).

I'll at least drive the Jag.

After straying from German and Japanes luxury iron back into the American waters with the CTS, I'm absolutely amazed the amount of performance, technology, robust build, high quality, etc that the Folks at Cadillac have been able to come up with.

As I was talking with another enhtusiast that other day, I mentioned this point. I also noted that perhaps it's not so amazing, given GM's debt was wiped off the books, the crustacean period management was shown the door, and listening more to the customers than the accountants would produce. Clean sheet, with all the engineering talent GM has, we're seeing some pretty nice resuts. My best freind has a new Corvette Sting Rey.....MERCY! Porsche who? While a bit small for my tastes, I test drove an ATS. Now THAT is a fun drive.

Ben....I love me some Acuras. And, while improvements to the ILX sound promising, Acura seems to have transformed into a premium SUV company. I liked the TLX I had the opportunity I test drove. But, the hotly contested $45K-$50K market is strewn with gerat cars that offer some pretty potent entres.

Heck, the wife's Accord EX-L is prett darn nice....as a performer, as a tech car, great build, good materials. We looked at the ILX and couldn't make the case for it given the Accord, all loaded up, was cheaper. One could say that the Accord V6 butts heads with the TLX. I became smitten with the SH AWD version of the TL (and that version was world class). But, even there, Acura didn't move the bar forward from the previous version. At the end of the day, I preferred the TL SH AWD to the TLX SH AWD. That's not a good thing when you're trying to sell your new iron.

But, as visiting my sister and on the way, with some time to kill, I passed an Audi dealer. Pulled in and saw they had 3 S3s. Dealer plate on and away we went.

Fast car. A little small, but it reminded me of the A4 from probably 5 or 6 model years ago. Having owned the S4, the controls were all familiar. If I could only use one word to describe it? HIGHSTRUNG. If feels like it always wants to race. Suspension dances on the line between harsh and firm but never quite crosses over to harsh. You know it's working.....all the time, though. Seat of the pants performance tells me it's about the same as the S4. DSG was fun. Engine gets on the boil right now.

The good news...the quattro system didn't bind like it did with my S4. It operated seamlessly. The bad news is it reminds me of some of the GM cars from the '90s. ""yeah....we can make a suspension that will corner....you'll have to put up with a ride that makes you tired and hurt your butt, but it can be done"". The suspesnion of the S3 just wears you out on anything other than glass smooth roads. The S4 would still be the way I'd go, for the better suspension alone, but the S3 would make me think twice given the price difference.

If I had to go German, and I wanted a fast German sports car, I'd probably save myself a lot of money and go with the Audi's younger sibling.....the VW GTI.

You'll have to settle for the Golf R for a stick option. If you ask me, it's a fairly decent bargain since it isn't detuned mechanically. I still think the Audi interior and longer warranty and better customer service is worth at least a few grand, so it's a toss up depending on what you value. From what I've seen, there's better quality control in Ingolstadt than Mexico.

I found the S4 to be stronger ""seat of the pants"" than the S3 though. 7th gear on the DSG is worth it too.

Now, if they could just re-release the S4 being 300 lbs. lighter it would be perfect.

Maybe that's what made you not get all the BANG you paid for in the S4, because I'm surprised you felt the S3 just as quick (I know the 0-60 times tend to agree with you), but the S4 is underrated, and did you ever use the ""launch control technique"" described in the manual?

You can get a 235ix for that money, which can be had with a manual transmision, handles as well and has a more liveable suspension.

The price is around $850 for 3 years... On a lease, it adds 1% to the residual, so the actual cost is closer to $400.. Which is pretty cheap for three years of scheduled maintenance.

Soured on Audi? Probably more than a little truth in that statement. Still, the S3 is something other than a refined piece in my estimation. Personally, I'd skip it for $50K and get the S4 for around the same money. Or, the afore mentioned M235i or the ATS-V. Save a bit and get a GTI or R. Either would be more livable and you'd be able to stuff some green back into your pocket.

Ohio winters really aren't that bad, at least not compared to Boston, Chicago or New York. In the southern part of Ohio, we get a couple of dustings most winters. Every 3rd or 4th year, something more ""wintery"" happens, but I can live with that.

I have business colleagues who live in and around San Francisco. I tell them all the time, their winters can be difficult to drive in, too. They don't get any snow, but the Bay Area is wet and cold most of the winter. Not fun to drive in because their traffic is so much worse.

I like AWD installed in FWD platforms because it curbs some of the issues inherent in FWD cars. RWD doesn't have any of that. So, slap on some snow tires in the winter (just in case) and I'd be good to go.

2225,markcincinnati,February 2015,"The loaded S3 I test drove did indeed seem to just cross into the harsh ride category. The interior at freeway legal speeds seemed to show off its lack of sound deadening, too. A drive from Cincinnati to Cleveland would probably be wearying.

The performance was very impressive -- the thing was super willing to be at full cry seemingly in one second. The handling -- this one had the magnetic suspension option -- was confidence inspiring. The transmission was great -- better than any manual, BUT it was the 6-speed version. The 7-speed seems like it would be a better choice due to the addition of another overdriven gear.

The audio system was very good, not knock your socks off good, but premium ""enough."" That stupid pop up nav screen looks like one of those after market units (from Pioneer) from decades ago. Don't know why Audi chose to do that, when they had the built in look down to a science. But, that is personal preference.

For a change, Porsche now does the integration of the Nav.infotainment system better than Audi. What a world/

At a north of $50K price, the S4 (at least today's S4) seems like a bargain compared to the S3.. Of course a stripped S3 makes a strong performance argument, but, sadly, the premium-ness has been dialed way down. The interior is almost austere -- but perhaps minimalism is the look they were going for.

I would never get a black on black one -- the interior felt like a little teeny weenie cave -- a lighter color would have certainly upped the luxury/premium quotient.

Audi will sell as many of these as they can mint -- I would assume the market for the S3 would have to top out around mid-30;s (age wise). If you can afford an S3, you can afford an S4 and probably even a nicely equipped 3-series (without the i6 engine, however.) You can certainly afford a maxed out A4 SLine -- which wouldn't have the stump pulling torque, but it would have the 8 speed trans a less jittery sport suspension and actually FEEL like a premium car.

I am clearly not the S3 (or A3) target market. Hell, I'm scheming for an S6 -- and hoping for an improved and all new S4 in a year or two from now.

2227,benjaminh,February 2015,"Good reviews so far for the 2016 Acura ILX with the 2.4 DI engine (201 hp) and the 8 speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Starting msrp: $28k, undercutting the Audi A3 by $2k while getting to 60 more than a second faster....

From Motor Trend:

""Acura lost the 2.0-liter engine and dropped in a 2.4-liter, direct injection, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that creates 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. It also introduces the first dual-clutch eight-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter and paddle shifters that seem to always know the right gear at the right time. It launches with aggressive power, and once first gear winds out, it quickly shifts and maintains that torque until you let off the gas. There's a touch of torque steer to pull you to the right under heavy acceleration off the line, but that quickly disappears and leaves you with a compact rocket on the road.

The electric power steering is taut and very linear, snapping back to center with ease. Driving around Napa, California's, winding mountain roads, the ILX kept its line through every corner and never let up. It's smooth but feels quick and allowed me a chance to make my driving partner just a little bit carsick after a few twisty corners. Acura also improved the car's braking, allowing it to remain smooth and quick. For those who want the car to do the driving for you, the ILX offers adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. I'm not particularly fond of the lane-keep assist system, because it seems to work even when I didn't want it to, pulling me back to the center of the lane during faster driving, but I should have merely turned it off then. On the highway, it does a nice job of smoothly adjusting the car back to the middle of the lane.

Acura added a number of quieting technologies in the car, including active noise cancelation and additional deadening materials. This was quite noticeable. The car is remarkably quiet, especially considering it's built on the Civic platform, which is not the quietest compact around. A quiet ride remains one of the hallmarks of luxury, and the ILX allows for easy conversations at any speed. The interior improvements are just as noticeable as the exterior ones. There are steps up in the quality of materials, the soft dash, and nicely done stitching throughout the cabin. (The A-Spec model includes aluminum floor pedals and special seat inserts.) There are all of the regular luxury items, such as a moonroof, a clean instrument cluster, and comfortable heated seats. When you sit down in this car, you notice that it's nicely done.""

2228,benjaminh,February 2015,"Another review of the 2016 ILX by Left Lane News:

""Cruising along the Silverado trail in Napa, California, gave us a quick taste of the ILX's improvements. From the moment we pushed the red starter button, we could see that Acura had corrected many of the motivational issues that plagued the last car. And to their credit, Acura executives acknowledged as much, when during the presentation about the vehicle's new features, they stated that they had taken many an expert's comments to heart.

In addition to the lack of power, one of the bigger complaints of the previous version was the excessive road noise that made its way into the cabin. The NVH guys got it right this time, utilizing tricks and techniques that made a huge difference that was quantifiable in back-to-back tests.

For 2016, buyers will get a taste of just what 51 extra horsepower and an additional 40 lb-ft of torque are capable of, especially in a car that weighs only 3,100 pounds. We found a compact four-door sedan that offered up just the right amount of torque steer when we launched from a standing start. They didn't post exact times but Acura officials state the ILX gets to 60 mph 2.5-seconds faster than the model it replaces. And that was in the normal drive mode. Switching over to sport mode allowed us to put the paddle shift levers to good use as we blipped our way up through the eight-speed gearbox.

The M235i is the only sub-$50k BMW I would put in my driveway. My Audi dealer pretty much soured me on the marque due to the aggravation they caused every time I've tried to deal with them(I didn't want an Audi, but my wife was interested in an A4Q).

By the way, those ""experts"" in the video should know that-on this side of the pond, anyway- a ""Bimmer"" is a BMW car and a ""Beemer"" is a BMW bike...

2231,stickguy,February 2015,"Ben, thanks for that. I saw the piece in MT I think. See, this now sounds like the car I should have waited for. Exactly what my wish list it pretty much. I really liked the interior and size. Upping the speed and driving experience is all that it really needed. and if they kept the price the same, it should be a very good deal.

Actually, it sounds more like the original tsx, which it probably is close in size to. and that car I always loved.

Too bad I already got something. But heck, I'll still stop in to take a look when they finally come out. Plan ahead I always say!

I am sure the comparison was to the FWD 1.8 A3. which makes sense, because they are closest in concept and price. Not really comparable to a 40K 2.0t model.

2232,graphicguy,February 2015,"Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX. Wife tried one before settling on the Accord. Tough sell. Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord. Hard to make that fly.

I did like the TLX. But, I didn't like it as well as the TL. So, no go there, too. RLX? Should have saved development money and killed it off. It's barely selling as well as the previous dismal RL. My hope is that there's something Acura is planning (maybe the turbo 4 in the TLX) like a TLX-S because as it stands right now, they're an SUV brand, who happens to throw a few cars in the showroom just in case you need one of those, too.

No secret that Audi just seems to confound their customers...whether it's ""Sween's"" $300 oil change, or them playing ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" about the problems my S4 had. Troubling enough it was on the dealer level. Worse, the Audi factory team weren't any better. That attitude eventually catches up to you. You'd think their customer service would be a lot better given how they were almost wiped out of existence in the '80s with the hatchet job they got with unintended acceleration.

S3 will sell. Not sure the age group. It gives a lot of performance. But, those it's targeting are raising families. Is it big enough? For $50K is it really nice enough?? Interior was underwhelming, as Mark pointed out. The materials were not what I'd consider worthy of a $35K car, let alone a $50K car. And, it seems to be a German thing, but who was it that decided a stuck on LCD screen sticking up in the middle of the dash was a ""new trend""? Somebody in their design dept needs a serious remedial course in aesthetics.

Even if a childless couple ends up liking the S3, not sure it's demeanor will appeal given some alternatives who have sharp handling, and a more sophisticated ride. My money? Stuck in an Audi showroom with no other competitor to be found within 1,000 miles? I'd write the check for the S4 for about the same money. Better car, better interior, better suspension, better transmission, better engine....better all the way around.

BMW? Cadillac? VW? Any of those dealers close? I'd be sticking my checkbook back in my pocket and looking at those over the Audi.

Even Mercedes, which has given up its chase to be a sharp performer, puts out a decent product in the $50K range...C Class. Aside from the silly stick up screen (again), it has a nice interior and makes no apologies that it rides nice, while maybe not offering the last 10th in handling or performance.

Buy, the CLA's suspension is every bit as ragged as the Audi's. Interior is....ummm....interesting. Not nearly as nice as the ATS nor an uber conservative 2 or 3 Series. But, it has a star on the front. So, for many, that's all that's needed.

I liked my Audi...when I drove it off the showroom floor. It became troublesome almost immediately. When the dealer stone walls you (and I'm not the only person who's had that happen in these parts), it makes a frustrating situation unbearable. So long Audi.

Had sterling customer service from BMW, and again with my CTS. Need an oil change? New wipers? Got a little parking lot ding? No problem. Leave it with the dealership, who gladly gives you a loaner to use, only to get your car back later all clean and shiny with everything taken care of.....NO CHARGE!

The dealership experience makes all of the difference, doesn’t it? When I was younger, I could not understand why anyone would pay the money for a new Cadillac. Then I owned my first Cadillac (not new, but new enough to be under factory warranty). After that, I truly did understand.

I no longer have that kind of money to throw around, but if I did, I would be driving a Cadillac.

Dealerships go a long way to form the perception of any brand. I've been born beat even by Mercedes dealerships, and I've been treated like gold at Chevy dealerships. At the Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes dealerships, you expect better, though. You expect the sales and service reps to listen and respond to what you want or need. Not to resort to arm twisting to get you to buy or become deaf to your communications when talking about issues with your car.

My BMW, Acura, and now my Cadillac dealer can't do enough to listen and respond to what I communicate. My Audi dealer couldn't do too little in response to the same. Guess which dealerships I'll contact first when I decide to get another vehicle? Pretty easy answer.

As you say, I'm comparing the Audi A3 1.8 with the 2016 Acura TLX 2.4.

Car and Driver seems to put the A3 1.8 0-60 at 7.3, while the 2016 TLX C&D puts at 6.2. One second faster is a pretty significant difference.

When these two models are comparably equipped with leather, heated seats, backup camera, etc. I think the Audi goes for about $33k while the TLX goes for about 3k less. The Audi has more prestige and arguably nicer interior design, but the Acura is quite a bit faster and might even have better handling around corners. At least one test of the A3 1.8 that I saw complained about excessive roll and lean around corners. Plus, I think most would agree that for long term reliability an Acura beats an Audi.

Here's what Auto Week says at the end of it's review:

If you’re looking for an entry-level sports sedan, you’ll definitely want to consider the 2016 ILX now. The new drivetrain has done wonders for Acura’s gateway vehicle, giving it adequate muscle to make a stand against the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA. The engine is potent and is definitely a throwback to Honda/Acura 4-cylinders of old that once powered vehicles like the Acura Integra and Honda Prelude.

Handling will also remind you a little of the brand’s sportier performers from the past, which should be music to a Honda/Acura fan’s ears.

2243,markcincinnati,February 2015,"Assuming my comments are not banned: We have two Audi dealerships in Cincinnati. I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection.

We have two BMW dealerships, too. Purchased three Bimmers from one of them -- The BMW Store -- over the years.

These two dealerships -- the ones that we have purchased from have been wonderful to deal with from a sales perspective AND a service perspective. Out of more than two dozen Audis we have had, we did have one that was problematic (actually the brakes were the issue). Audi of America sent their area representative to help out the situation. As usual, the dealer was helpful in making such a thing happen.

OK, I get it -- your mileage may differ. I agree with whoever said -- get rid of the bad ones (or words to that effect). No mfgr can tolerate even a very small number of crappy dealers. The Internet spreads the tales of woe like a Cancer. I know dealers are often local business people, not mega corporations -- although this is changing, in the era of the $1B dealership ""groups.""

The dealer can do harm, sometimes great harm to a brand -- and god knows Audi can't afford a sub-par dealer. No mfgr can.

If you need to buy or lease a new Audi and you are within 250 miles of Cincinnati, you can certainly buy one here -- but that probably does you little good with respect to service after the sale. You need a relationship with your dealer somewhat like your relationship with your ""barber"" (or hair dresser if you don't like the term barber). Of course, if you don't work at the relationship too, it won't pan out favorably, probably.

My Audi service mgr and I have been on a first name basis for perhaps 15 years -- our sales rep, in his mid-80's finally retired; he had been at the dealership since the discovery of dirt. Our new guy only has 12+ years with the dealer, he is so new he's still learning where the restroom is.

The time on the job of the various players at the dealership is a huge clue. If the lot tech guy and your sales rep have about the same tenure, you'd be better off finding out the tenure, overall, of the reps. Ditto the shop people, shop foreman, service manager and service writers. My service adviser has been at the dealership for at least a decade.

The Audi Connection is the poster child for what a dealership should look like. The BMW Store has a similar tenure with its people and the dealer experience is all the better for it.

If you have a bad dealer, I do feel for you -- if you can, get the hell away from them."

It happens I'm 50, not that you would have known, and so it's not like I need to google that 6-speed Legend. I admired it back in the day.

In some ways perhaps the Germans are ahead of the 2016 ILX. For instance, the A3 seems to have nicer interior design. And the BWM 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling.

But the Audi A3 under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k VW Golf. That doesn't seem different to me than an ILX having some common bones with a $20k Honda Civic. They take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. Well, I'm not so sure about the engine for the A3, now that I think about it. Isn't that basically the new standard Golf 1.8 turbo engine? Not sure.

A turbo for the ILX might be nice, but I think the ILX 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. And the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.

And when it comes to reliability and long term ownership, many would take an Acura over an Audi or MB. If you're just leasing and want the prestige, then the others are probably better choices. But if you're actually buying it for yourself and plan on keeping it, then Lexus, Acura, etc., might have an edge there.

Dealership is the front line of your ownership experience. As the old saying goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"".

My wife is a lot more forgiving than I am when it comes to customer service. She's the one who is willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Me? I don't care if it's my real estate agent, my stock broker, my car sales person, or even my landscaper,

Car dealerships (and in turn, car manufacturers) expect me to live up to my commitment when buying a car to pull 10s of thousands of dollars out of my wallet for their product. I expect that they live up to their promise that the car will operate as they said it would. And, if it doesn't, I expect them to make it right without pushback. That last part is where Audi got in trouble.

The dealership Mark is referring to was actually at least moderately helpful, but still unwilling or unable (maybe both) to fix the car. Their Service Manager said the DSG trans and components of the Quattro system needed to be replaced. In a moment of unusual honesty, he said that Audi had a problem with some of the components for the drivetrain that were out of spec. He thought he'd get the green light to do the repair. That authorization never happened. The service manager said at one point that the Regional Audi Rep told him the car was too expensive to fix. Not that it couldn't be fixed, but that he thought it costs too much to fix it. Really? I mean REALLY? Guess what? It was 4X more expensive to buy back and label the car as a corporate buy back.

It wasn't just me with the issues. One of the trade rags I read after they bought mine back, mentioned the same issue. I looked for recalls. Never saw any.

The Audi Customer Service people suggested I take it to the other Audi dealer in town. I have no proof, but I think they looked at it, test drove it, called the Region, got stonwalled and essentially just changed the trans fluid. Clearly, that wasn't the problem as it still existed as I drove it away from their service bay. Took it back to them a 2nd time. Can't remember what they actually did, but it didn't fix the problem.

At that point, Audi had the car for a total of about 6+ weeks. They came back and said lemon law didn't apply because I had the car in for two separate issues. It was the same issue, that needed two fixes....Quattro and DSG. I don't know what they thought....perhaps I was just going to forget about it?

Icing on the cake....called Audi Customer Care (allegedly a Supervisor who had been assigned to my case), who proceeded to tell me the reason none of the local Audi dealerships would service my car, was because I didn't buy it from them. Uhhhhh.....izzatright? That's not what both of the Audi dealers told me. Game on. You're buying the car back, which they ended up doing.

I told Mark's dealer what I thought could have/should have happened. They should have either replaced the trans and Quattro components. Or, they should have just swapped the car for one that worked correctly. Neither was offered....and believe me, I did ask. They wanted me to take a about a $10K hit to swap out the car, though. Yeah....that's really fair!

As far as the Caddy? I'm not expecting the same resale percentage numbers I was used to getting with my Acuras 9which were exemplary). That said, I bought it right ($15K and change dff MSRP). So, I took the good deal up front with getting a great deal instead of on the back end when it comes trade time.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
2248,graphicguy,February 2015,"Mark....I think the Audi Connection could be a very good dealership. I think they were hampered by their Regional Rep. Plus, neither them nor the one on Beechmont could come close to the deal I got out of the Chicago Audi Dealership (Westmont). We're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference). I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I'd save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again. The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership. I can't even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that.

Went to Dayton Audi store, too. They were more like the old ""let me get my manager to see if we can make a deal"". After waiting 30 minutes for this manager to show up, I left their store. Sales person tried to stall me more, but enough was enough.

BMW Store is good. They never seem to have what I want. They have a pretty rigid set of criteria of cars they order from Stuttgart. They seem to get a lot of base models with base drivetrains. I tend to want the ones with the bigger, better drivetrains, which Sweeney always seems to have. I have a personal relationship with ""my guy"" at Sweeney BMW, though. He's been there for probably 20+ years. I've bought 3 BMWs from him. Deal is always skinny, and simple. Anything I've ever had go wrong, it's taken care of. No questions, no pushback, no fuss, no muss. No issue is too small for them (nor too large).

We're not so different. We deal with people we trust. I think that's true of most people.

I remember talking about the CTS and how I liked it and you mentioned that you wouldn't step in a Caddy dealer because of how they treated your mother many years prior, but giving you 15K off MSRP changed that for you.... Now if the dealer came back with only 7% off MSRP would you have taken the dealer? But in the end, money talks and did for you... I'm sure anyone would have taken the dealers deal of 15K off a 60K car I'm sure you lease payments are lower then what your TL was.

so I don't really need a luxury spa, since most of the time I am there I am checking out the new cars (at Acura or one of the other dealers in the complex), and if the car needed to stay longer, I would just get a loaner and not hang around.

Sween....you and I agree (O.M.G..... . Wife being in an Accord, I'm beginning to see the Honda engineering in a lower priced car vs the Acura counterparts. I drove the TLX. Nice car. Not the same driving experience as the TL-S models or even the SH AWD TL that I had. Admittedly, I like the look of the new one better than the old one, but didn't have an issue with the ""beak"" look that others did.

Truth told, if Audi had just fixed my S4, I'd still be in the fold. Instead, they lost me. I have to believe I'm smack dab in the wheelhouse of their demographic, too.

Bang for the buck, an S4 is hard to beat.

But, as these things go, every body is stealing from everyone else. My CTS AWD has the trick torque vectoring rear that the Audi Quattro and Acura TL SH AWD have. My CTS has the twin scroll turbo that the BMW 4 cyl has (and more power to boot). Get the V-Sport (last year could be had for high $40s). and you get the 6 cyl with two turbos...wicked fast.

Took a couple of weeks, but once I got used to CUE, I ""get it"". And, I like it. My understanding is they went through a couple of interim updates to get it to this point, though.

ILX needs that turbo motor. Otherwise, stick with a Civic.

The Civic and Accord are great cars. Are their Acura counterparts worth $X,ooo more? It's not clear cut. So I guess that's pretty telling.

That said, I loved all the Acura I've had. Not sure they shouldn't just go ahead and just be an upscale SUV brand and be done with it. Maybe they're hoping the new NSX will breathe life into their car sales. The ILX and the TLX both need that turbo 4, though. The TLX, in particular, looks like a took a step back going from the sweet 3.7L in the previous gen SH AWD version to the 3.5L in the current car. Not sure what the thought process was there. In the tech dept, where they used to be at the forefront, they're now lagging behind, even with a totally new refresh.

BTW....here's my BMW dealer......http://www.sweeneybmw.com/index.htm


FN....if the prospect of getting $15K+ off a CTS wasn't out there, no way I would have entered the Cadillac showroom. My issues with Cadillac came before the GM ""purge"". I think the Cadillac dealers had to get into shape or the prospect of GM cutting them became quite real. That was very evident in my experiences with the same dealership 11 years ago, and the experience with them now. Truly, it was a night and day difference.

Drove the ATS. Thought it was a really fun car. A tad small for my tastes (reminded me of the A3, sidewise). Drove the CTS, and had as much fun, only with all the trappings of an E Class, A6, 5 Series......a better suspension than any of those, with better steering, braking, etc. A Cadillac....right? Who'd have thunk it.

Frankly, if I didn't get such a good deal on the CTS, I would have been targeting an IS350 F-Sport, probably this summer. That's a fun car, too. A little on the snug side (and I'm not a big guy).

LOL @ $300 oil changes. I won't be getting my Audi serviced at the dealership again; it's just too much of a rip off. For your $300 they probably do lube things (joints/hinges, ect.) do a 150 pt. inspection, but in the end, it's just an oil change. I got them to give me 15% off because even at 10% off I felt as I was being ripped off (I originally thought 15K service included a new engine air filter at least; it doesn't!). They are making their maintenance intervals a lot longer it seems.

I have a question (prompted by an article I read about the RS7): Audi, today, uses the DSG transmission on the S4, S5, S6 and S7, for instance. Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic. The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine. The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.).

Can the DSG in the S4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? If not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?

My dealer says the S4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard V6T in the 2016 A6 line. It means, to me, that they have resolved the DSG issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current DSG to take the upgrade is my concern."
2266,sweendogy,February 2015,M @all - I have to go tru the dealer recipe and confirm but it was 330 bux all in after taxes - no tire rotation and pretty much an oil change and a car wash which after getting 5 feet of snow the very next week did nothing.

I'm not worried about it. When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one. Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque. I'm not too worried about it. I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission.

I don't know -- and with all due respect, I don't know how you know -- about Audi deciding the RS7 customer would not track the car, hence they (Audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars. It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor.

I have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its comfort zone. I don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.

Frankly, I think it would be less costly to get a new ""S"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the DSG with the upgrade.

Of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.

My experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why I am concerned -- I chipped my wife's TT and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and I assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.

My wife swore (and I couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her TT were chip related.

We traded the car in for a newer TT with the FACTORY upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.

My A3 mods did the opposite of souring me on mods. If anything though, I felt they over advertised the power improvements , or at least overstated them, didn't pass the butt dyno.

I can understand being soured to tuning if you've had issues in the past. However, if the car was old, maybe it was just due to have those same failures anyway? Also, what kind of tune (company?) was it. I got Unitronics with the A3, and part of their sales spiel is that they tune it with OEM like reliability and durability in mind. Of course, my S4 tune will be Revo, so new territory. I find the Audi components to be over engineered so that they can handle these tunes with ease if done right.

The storm was Sunday - started out with about 8-10"" of snow, then changed to rain for an hour or so, then about 2 hours of freezing rain with a flash freeze as temps plummeted. The result of it all was that everything had 1""-2"" of ice on pavement/sidewalks under the snow crust. I didn't even try to drive anywhere until today after 2 days of clearing efforts around the house. The roads here are atrocious. Even main routes aren't all down to bare pavement since there is caked ice stuck to the pavement in areas that is really hazardous. Side streets are still mostly all ice since it has been too cold for road salt to do much. Add to that all the snowbanks from previous storms making roads narrow, with many merge lanes on expressways simply not there. I'm not going anywhere over the next few days because it is still too risky.

2294,laurasdada,February 2015,"Annual Father/Son ski trip to Sunday River in Maine this week. Left a day earlier than planned as predictions of blizzard conditions Sunday morning. So, drove through some blizzard conditions Saturday night! The XF was a rock star, AWD/All Seasons tracked steady and true. Stopped for dinner in York, pulled up restaurants on the Nav, told son to pick one. I guess I missed the turn as we found ourselves driving through residential, one lane (due to snow) roads that hadn't been plowed recently. So, probably 6+"" snow, no problem for the XF! Used the rear foglight, oversight on Jag's part, no front fogs... One hour dinner, 2+"" new snow on top of the car! But, light and fluffy.

Woke up Sunday expecting a plethora of fresh powder to ski...and nothing. It didn't snow the entire four days we were there. The wind did howl mightily, though. Kept lifts closed, so 3 days of skiing turned into more like 1.5. Probably good for me, skied trees and bumps. I ain't 16 like my son. Oh, my achin' back!

2308,sweendogy,February 2015,Why talk about lease prices and not the actual selling price?
2309,markcincinnati,February 2015,"I have to assume the Q50 has been an underwhelming sales performer -- hence lease subvention to the rescue.

I still see plenty of the Q50's predecessor, the G37X, on the road -- and they have kept the thing alive as a Q40.

I also see plenty of the larger Infinitis on the road -- but the Q50s sit and sit and sit on the dealer's lots.

My wife says they are soul-less machines. I actually like the Q50's styling -- but the engine is basically unchanged from the previous G's and the transmission isn't as good of a partner as you could want and as you certainly expect -- at MSRP. But subvented, well the mo/pay has to make the Q50 attractive.

I always thought of BMW as the German Infiniti -- perhaps the incentives will gin up some greater enthusiasm for the Brand and the model.

Maybe there's something rotten in Hong Kong (or Tokyo); maybe that's why Audi's former US President spent to little time with Infiniti and jumped to Cadillac before the paint in his new Hong Kong office dried."

Yes.. I am saying that they are a great value to lease at $350 compared to the purchase price. So cheap, that you'll be many thousands worse off by buying the car, then selling it after three years.

Infinitis often have great lease programs that aren't in line with their actual resale value. It's the manufacturer's method of heaping big incentives on the car. It's not a general lease vs. buy argument. It's specific to the situation.

2319,markcincinnati,February 2015,"A sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.

Years back, Jaguars leased for STUPID numbers (very very low per month) -- the cars were discounted, but not enough to justify NOT leasing. The odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value.

Here's how they did it (or at least how it was done by some mfgrs):

The lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for X months (lets say 24 or 36). To determine the lease, the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something IMPOSSIBLE let's say 70% of MSRP. Then they took the 30% of MSRP and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy, artificially low (sub-vented) lease price per month. In some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70% or at least some part of the 70%. Then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose. In some cases you actually had to keep the car -- you could NOT simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook.

Yet, for those that wanted an $80,000 (pick a car) for $399 per month with no money down, there was simply no way a purchase made any sense.

Now, Infiniti certainly does sub-vent, but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example. The payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low, but remember you are paying for the sub-vented cost of use of the car (which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front).

Then at the conclusion of the lease there is MAYBE the possibility of getting the car for its real, honest, market value -- not the bloated, made up residual. If the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever, you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was, er, ""rent controlled.""

Infiniti's can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a sub-venting process. As far as Acura's are concerned, their financial arm hasn't always been a flexible in that regard -- but perhaps it is because they didn't need to with the MDX being the lion's share of their business.

It seems to me the TLX (and I come from a TL and actually liked it) was/is a missed opportunity to de-Honda-ize the brand. At this point, however nice they are, they are, underneath, Prime Hondas. That is not a bad thing, but the thing that I always thought about Infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a BMW. Acuras are still sold as FWD vehicles (a big mistake if you axe me), the Infiniti in question here is, actually, really and truly, a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with AWD (very BMW-ish, there).

Moreover, don't go thinking Lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis Toyota as Acuras are compared to Hondas.

But, so it seems, the market has spoken and the Infiniti cars are not the leaders of the pack, more like the laggards of the pack -- hence super-sub-venting to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection.

We bought our first car last year a $65,000+ Audi SQ5 -- we put $22,000 down, have a 2.25% APR note on it and it is now showing at being worth about $48K. We still owe $33K on it. We've lost, in my estimation, $7K -- had the thing been offered with a sub-venting finance package on a lease, well, that would have been a no-brainer. We're hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will, in year two, hit the brakes and that maybe we'll have a point in time where the car ""feels"" like it was a better decision to buy than to lease.

We'll see how it goes.

Meantime who cares what the car's MSRP is? Not most Americans. They, er, WE, only really care about the monthly payment.

When a $50K+ car can be had for $399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss, no fuss, well that hardly seems like a BAD thing. Speaking of sub-venting, Cadillac is doing the same thing with their CTS and ATS and XTS vehicles as we speak."

I wonder what the sales are on the TLX? I don't recall seeing any #s. It is a nice car, and certainly a good value. And $$ speak. I also think the refreshed 2016 ILX is going to help that model immensely. The RLX, however, is a lost cause.

No disagreements with you or Mark. Test driving the Q50, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither.

Acura is moving to the soft side like it seems every other alleged ELLSS (with the exception of Audi and Cadillac) is heading....soft. Still, Acura TLX is going to sell 45,000 TLXs in '15. Is there enough of a delta between an Accord and the TLX? Not sure. Drove a TLX. It drives differently from my wife's Accord. Enough to justify the price difference? I still like them. $45K at the tippy top end for a technologically rich, 6 cyl with AWD and torque vectoring rear seems pretty compelling.

2325,robr2,February 2015,Acura sold 2900 TLX's in January compared to 1400 TL's and 900 TSX's in January 2014 - so about a 25% jump compared to the old models it replaces.
2326,graphicguy,February 2015,"I just saw that the Honda President was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things. The article I read said he had navigated Honda/Acura through the Global recession, the tsunami in Japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies.

I guess this means they don't really care what monumental obstacles you face, deliver to the bottom line or your gone.

Personally, I think Honda got away from what they did best with Acura. That is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical. RLX (and the RL before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade. As good as the TL is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road. The new one is better. Acura really didn't have an answer for the Integra's demise.

By default, they became a luxury SUV company. It seems past those who view an Escalade as having ""made it"", the MDX is the lux SUV of choice with the upper middle class. I still like their products. Whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami, they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market, or whether they lost their desire to lead, they seem to just be missing the mark with their cars. I hope they continue to fire products at the segment because it's hard to find cars that are as well built, drive so nicely, are as bulletproof reliable, and are good values as my Acuras were. Unfortunately, that's not enough these days.

Aside from the NSX I never gave Acura the slightest bit of consideration; when I'm spending $35k or more FWD cars and FWD biased AWD cars simply aren't on my radar.

I did notice a better feel from the S4's 60/40 RWD emphasis with the AWD system, that does make it feel better and more RWD-like. On the TL-SH-AWD it felt FWD and when you gassed it, you could feel, AND see even graphically on the screen how it shifted some torque rearward, but most of it always started out in front.

Just one more reason why I felt the S4 was worth the extra dough.

2339,sweendogy,February 2015,I would say the best reason to get rid of the TL was its awful looks- people can talk about how close it was to the s4 but in actuality it wasn't - ugly fat and boring - no way to go thu life.

2342,graphicguy,February 2015,"I get people not liking the styling of the TL. Personally, I did like it. I thought it was bold and unique, which suited me fine.

I've owned both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. TL SH AWD is mighty close to the Audi. No, the TL wasn't as fast as the S4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. It matched the S4 in the feature category. Service costs on the TL vs the S4 were miniscule in comparison. MPG was certainly better on the TL vs the S4, too. And, for the money I paid (under $40K) for the TL SH AWD Advance it offered huge value.

Don't get me wrong, I liked my S4. Didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the S4 and didn't like the MPG, nor the maintenance costs, either.

2345,markcincinnati,February 2015,"I did like my TL SH-AWD Advance. I thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a Honda that knew somebody. The air conditioned seats were great. The power was good, nothing to scare an S4. The brakes were very weak. The doors sounded tinny when closed. It was a beer to the Audi's champagne. Yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was Honda's bargain basement S4.

I have to assume the new TL is an improvement. Mine, a 2012, had way too much FWD feel (torque steer), something the S4 doesn't have.

I don't have the S's sport diff (torque vectoring rear diff), wish I did, but I would assume if I did, I'd love this thing even more.

This car and my wife's SQ5 have become our favorite Audis and our favorite cars -- and we've had dozens -- of all time. I want to say nothing even comes close -- but our BMW's have been close (and even a couple VW's were a blast to drive, but still none are the performers of these S's.) I used to think they (Audi S cars) were too expensive, but compared to 3-series, well it seems these Audis are ""within reach"" of most folks who shop and buy the cars discussed on this forum.

If you ""can't see"" or ""don't share"" our (my wife's and mine, i.e.) passion for the Audi S's, I would say the TL or TLX SH-AWD with anything that increases the performance/handling ticked off on the option list, is not a bad alternative (if you can get past the styling and the Honda content.) But, for the money, the Acura may be attractive to you because it will almost certainly stay south of $50K..

If you can't stomach the TLX's looks and the Audi leaves you wondering what I see in them, well, the C class Mercedes, too, looks like it is worth a second look -- and I've always had a soft spot for the Volvo S60 type R.

An observation: many who write here about their cars make remarks like ""my TL gave me 6 trouble free years."" My irreverent side almost always reads, ""my TL gave me 6 [bland, boring, unremarkable, invisible] trouble free years."" If I remarked to my wife that she has given me 20 plus years of trouble free cohabitation,"" she'd have every right to punch me in the nose.

I want 6 trouble free years, too, but I think I'd take 3 spectacular driving experience years instead.

That's why I always say: Drive it like YOU live. Life's too short to not have at least some trouble!"
2346,markcincinnati,February 2015,"Some may recall that when I wanted to go ahead and get a 2014 Lexus IS350F with every option box ticked off (in metallic white with red leather), my wife said, ""we tried the Infiniti and the Acura, it just seems that they ain't got no soul . . . "" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months.

Here is what we noticed: Audi, BMW, Porsche and (to a lesser extent) Mercedes owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to Germany to visit the Holy Land (the factories where their cars are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrist watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. Acura, Infiniti and Lexus owners? Not so much.

So, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned Germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands. Other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local Infiniti dealer even had a Branded Boutique of items touting their owners love of their brand's cars.

The BMW store, in Cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say? Well, arrive at the BMW store bright and early on a Saturday morning and you will see a line of BMW's, perhaps 20 cars deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours. The customers park their cars, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free Starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable DVD players and headphones with a choice of movies. Often the folks chat about their adventures in their X5's or the pleasure they had picking up their cars in Spartanburg and driving back to Cincinnait. Some folks regale others about their European delivery pick up in Munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.

Sitting in the Acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the Infiniti dealer.

Somehow, the Germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their cars, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.

As the sign at the BMW dealer reminds: ""Don't Forget to Breathe!""

Have you ever been to Munich? If not, I can offer up a couple of restaurant recommendations that are equal to or better than restaurants in New York, Paris, London, Prague and Warsaw. If you're going to stay in country for more than a few days, I can also suggest a couple of relatively close destinations that are breathtakingly beautiful.

If you want to spend some time in your new BMW on the autobahn while heading toward one of the best little towns on the planet, I urge you to drive about 45-60 minutes south of Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, spend the night in the magnificent Hotel Reindl Partenkirchner Hof -- make absolutely sure you make dinner reservations at the hotel's restaurant, or risk being turned away -- the meal at this restaurant is worth planning, scheming and dreaming for.

The next day you can take the ski-lift up (and in July the view will be spectacular) where the 1936 winter Olympics were held. Then you can take another even more breathtaking cable car ride up the Zugspitze where you can have lunch and walk from Germany to Austria as the border cuts through the mountain. If you have time -- and I would urge you to make time -- you can drive your new BMW to Füssen and visit Neuschwanstein Castle.

After that day you can either drive back to Garmisch or motor on into Innsbruck, Austria or back to Munich.

If you want some restaurant recommendations in Munich, let me know.

Have fun -- that's another thing Germans know how to do so well."

2352,benjaminh,March 2015,"The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....

2016 ILX base
$27,900 msrp
0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D)
hp 201
trunk: 12.3
8 speed DSG
29 mpg comb

2015 Audi A3 1.8
$29,900 msrp
0-60: 6.5 (C & D)
hp 170
trunk 10
6 speed DSG
27 mpg

Each one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.

But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.

Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.

If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.

The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.

Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there.

Both are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX.

Well, time will tell. The outgoing model consistently lost every comparison test to the Buick Verano, much less the A3. Once the usual car magazine introductory hype dies down it will be a better time to assess.

2017 Cadillac ATS Performance Premium 3.6"
2354,markcincinnati,March 2015,"Few A3's (at least in our climate in SW Ohio) will not be quattros. Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong.

There is something special about German cars -- eloquently described elsewhere by both the pro-writers and us amateurs -- that makes me think most ""Audi"" shoppers will first cross shop the other Germans, then perhaps another European brand, then, maybe, a Japanese brand.

I asked the Audi dealer who (the brand) they compete with. The answers depended on the car, of course, but the A3 and ILX were never mentioned in the same sentence. Now, granted, this is a data point; and this is perhaps indicative only of Cincinnati shopper's habits. The names (brands) brought up included BMW (doh!), Mercedes and Porsche -- the Macan vs the Q5/SQ5 for instance.

Acura's today inhabit that unenviable position where Audi used to live: Acuras are Hondas when spoken of; Audis used to be Volkswagens as recently as 20 years ago. It wasn't until Audi moved farther and farther away from being a VW that knows somebody, that they were able to break into the Premium class. Acuras, so I thought, had made some pretty good inroads into no longer being ""fancy"" Hondas -- remember the RLX from the not too distant past? Now, they've slipped -- and for all I know the slippage is deliberate -- and gotten closer to their Honda roots. Simultaneously, Honda has kept moving forward and upward at a pace that Acura has apparently not been willing or able to keep pace with.

Don't get me wrong, I can't pinpoint something with respect to my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance that I can blast other than its ugly beak. Yet, just the reaction to the car itself was underwhelming. No one ever seemed to have any curiosity about my TL. The day I drove my new S4 into the office, however, folks were all over the thing, asking questions and showering it with praise.

The point is folks here in Cincinnati at least will fawn over a BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Audi and will hardly give an Acura or Infiniti the time of day. The Lexus IS 350 F sport, however, will attract car buffs and elicit questions -- as will a Cadillac ATS.

Maybe it's just that Cincinnati is a German town -- sister city to Munich, after all -- but at this point in time, Acura's just can't get no respect. I think were I somehow in a Bizarro world shopping for an ILX, I'd probably run, not walk, to the nearest VW dealer and look at a new VW CC R-line instead."
2355,benjaminh,March 2015,"markcincinnati: You make some good points. But for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about, Acura might be a choice again now. Maybe a small part of the lack of buzz for Acuras in your area is that they are actually made right in Ohio lol? Once the Acura NSX is launched later this year, might it inject a small amount of buzz into the brand?

2357,graphicguy,March 2015,"I don't know that I'd go so far as to say there's something special about German cars. I think after you own cars for awhile, and you've owned lots of brands/models, you see the differences in materials, engineering, build to be differentm, but not necessaily better, from one marque to the next.

Granted, BMW and Mercedes seem to do things differently than say Acura, or Infiniti (and certainly different than Cadillac). For example, try using the shifter in the BMW 5 Series or the column dhifter in most Mercedes. You kind of go....""who thoguht that was a good idea?"".

Audis better in that regard. But still, there seems to be a level of complexity in the German makers that isn't really necessary. Never owned a Mercedes, but in my Audi and BMWs, I attribute that to why maintenance and repairs are so high compared to an ATS, or CTS, or TL, etc. Does it make a BMW, Audi or Mercedes better? I've yet to see any evidence of that.

All that said, I do understand the appeal of BMW. I liked the ones I had, quite a bit. The dealerships are top notch. Their cars, while moving away from what I want in an ELLPS, are still top dogs in the category.

Lots of competition in the space, though. Plenty for everyone to choose from. And, they're all good entries in the space.

I am certain there are indeed car buyers who buy a brand for ""prestige."" There are perhaps business people who believe they must wear Armani suits, Prada shoes and sport Rolex watches on their wrists, and drive ""appropriate to their station"" autos for at least the reason that their clientele expect it of them. We may have become more shallow as a group of people overall (those of us in much of the world, not just the US); that is a debate for another place and time. The thing is, the folks [executives, C-level folks and VPs on up the chain] who hire corporate lawyers, CPAs, brokers, investment bankers, architects, interior designers, consultants and so forth would probably have different perceptions of the professional they were about to engage or the senior manager they were about to hire based on some of the candidates accoutrements.

Perception is reality so the saying goes.

You may be correct that a top o' the line KIA or Equus is virtually every bit as competent and luxurious as an S class, 7 series or A8L, but the market perception isn't there yet.

The point is not that someone may buy the car for the prestige -- although they may -- the point is that some force (""may the force be with you"") has imbued your Rolex watch with certain ""characteristics"" that set it apart from my beautiful, equally functional and competent-as-a-timepiece Tissot.

Given a choice, better yet, we've [all] learned that given a choice of being gifted with a new Impala LTZ or a somewhat like-sized BMW 5 series, we ""should"" pick the BMW. In the same vein, given a choice of an Acura RLX or a Mercedes E class, well, the Mercedes will be chosen over and over.

These assignments of prestige were earned somehow (weren't they?)-- is it possible it is because the E class or BMW or whatever has earned a reputation for inherent goodness and/or desirability and value that the RLX just can't compete with?

I don't know why an individual thinks they ""need or don't need"" prestige in their attire, car they drive, club they belong to or college they attend. I don't even care, really. What I am on about is how the thing -- that objet d'art -- perhaps got to be that way.

BMW's for example, may -- today -- no longer be the performance machines worshiped by some from an historical perspective. Perhaps BMW and the other [snooty?] Germans [and the people who buy them?] are simply resting on their laurels. Perhaps they are the naked emperors now. I wouldn't bet against them quite yet, however.

Perhaps Acura, Infiniti and Lexus (soon to be displaced by KIA, don't you know) will be dubbed the new Premium players by the cognoscenti of cars at Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, Road & Track and yes, even Consumer Reports. Look at the new CR magazine (best and worst car issue) and see where the Audi A6 comes in, just for the fun of it.

Most of us don't need our cars to be talked about. None of us wants our cars to be talked about as a negative reflection of us, however. But, we certainly don't mind if our cars (and the other stuff I mentioned above) paints us in a light that is positive. The real estate sales person who takes you around looking at houses in her new Q7 or Escalade may -- for good reason, who knows? -- make you feel like a winner compared to the sales person who drives you around in his obviously not new Chrysler 300. The lawyer who -- well you get the picture -- gives you confidence is probably the one who appears by some societal/cultural measure to be successful.

People need what they perceive they need -- and part of that perception of a given product comes from something the product has done to earn a certain reputation (prestige, some measure of prestige or lack of prestige altogether).

Cars are where they are due to many factors -- Acuras, not to pick on them, do not ""suggest"" the same thing as BMW's, for instance. You may or may not call that prestige, performance, price or even presence. Today, it is very, very likely that given a choice of a new Acura or BMW, ""most people"" will choose BMW.

The names Acura, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Cadillac, Lexus, Toyota, etc, etc, etc could have been used as substitutes in some of the preceding. It is not my intention to savage Acura or inordinately praise BMWs. Personally I am an Audi fan of the highest order. Between my wife and myself, we have owned American, German and Japanese cars since 1969 (mostly German, full disclosure). My experience with Acrua was, overall, positive -- and my TL was, in my estimation, Acura's somewhat successful imitation (bargain) Audi S4. I have no axe to grind with Acura, that is.

However, therefore, notwithstanding: I do notice that I am accorded certain societal, er ""perks"" when I wear my Breitling watch vs my Swiss Army and when I wear a certain designer sport coat vs Jos A Banks and when I arrive in an Audi vs an Acura or Infiniti. It's also better to be sporting a Mont Blanc pen instead of a Cross. It's better to be using an iPad than an Acer, And, it is better to order Ornellaia than E. & J. Gallo.

It just seems that we have arrived at a point in time where the Germans -- for whatever reason -- rule. Cadillac is on the rise, Acura is on the wane and both Infiniti and Lexus need to further rationalize their offerings, although Lexus seems to be doing just fine, thank you very much.

Just remember, good is the enemy of great.

Acura makes good cars.

I'm not sure folks buy BMW's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- I'm pretty certain a lot of BMW shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of BMW's reputation in that regard.

I would suggest that for some BMW's have the reputation as being ""the best"" -- so someone lusts for a BMW for a few years and then when that first ""big jump"" in comp or first ""big hit"" in an investment banking transaction that they were part of gives them that high five figure or six figure bonus comes along, well they go for ""the best"" which they think is a BMW.

My suspicion is that someone buys (or leases) a Porsche because it will make them appear to be an enthusiast, or, perhaps even more likely, they really ARE an enthusiast.

Or, and I hope this isn't really the case, someone buys that RS7 or 911 to suggest a certain size attribute of a body part. Or, the car is acquired simply to demonstrate the size of your check-book balance.

I read an article about people who seek speeding tickets so they can brag -- obtusely -- about their income, as in ""I can afford that [speeding ticket]."" That's inane -- maybe even insane.

Yesterday we were out and about in snowy Cincinnati -- only 4-wheel drive vehicles seemed to be venturing out -- I saw an A8L and my comment was, ""I don't care how much money we have, how big the bonus is, etc, don't ever get an A8 for me."" Sure the car suggests something about the owner's income -- but were I to think about spending inordinate sums of money to haul my skinny (or fat, as the case may be) butt around (mostly with no one else in the car with me), my choice would be an S6 -- pretty much the ultimate sleeper car if you axe me. Probably only a very few would even know of its somewhat lofty price tag, as a matter of fact. But that's just me. My friend buys A8's and never has any passengers in them -- I am so tempted to inquire if he has more money than sense. I just keep my mouth shut.

The folks I [superficially] socialize with at either the BMW Store or the Audi Connection here in River City, actually seem to be very much into Audis and BMWs and cars in general. They know, sometimes, as much as the sales personnel, about all of the cars ""in the BMW or Audi family.""

My wife and I attended a 2-day driving school in Spartanburg SC with a group of folks from all over the US and most of them owned both BMWs and non-BMWs and were very much car aficionados of the highest order.

I'm thinking folks buy these cars because the cars have earned the reputations as being the best -- some folks may think that means the best performing, some may think most luxurious. I've never met anyone who bought one to ""look like they were a 'brand-name-here' enthusiast"" though.

2363,markcincinnati,March 2015,"roadburner: You are, of course, correct -- for the most part those who attend driving events are enthusiasts and often well informed ones at that.

Earlier I had perhaps inartfully attempted to say that I noted the folks (customers) at BMW dealers did behave enthusiastically about BMWs and often cars in general and that I could not say the same was true at an Acura dealer (for instance). Even those ""dweebs"" who may incorrectly talk (gush perhaps?) about their BMW's V6 engines do continue somewhat to make the point -- the ""tone and tenor"" of the shoppers and buyers of BMWs and Audis is -- even when factually incorrect -- very much upbeat, excited and passionate.

The only thing I have ever seen, however, that even approaches the dweeby-ness you suggest is when someone at the Audi store asks me if my S4 (with the V6 T badge on it) has noticeable turbo-lag or some remark indicating they are unaware that Audis V6s are super, not turbo charged. I correct them, of course and they then ask me why Audi puts the ""T"" on both the super and turbo charged cars.

I give them the party line that is somewhat difficult to say with a straight face, we both shrug and I then tell them my S4 is both incredibly quick off the line and very fast thanks to the instantaneous response only a supercharged (or, granted, a naturally aspirated) engine can offer.

Even the dweebs are excited at the Audi and BMW store is the point -- the folks [shoppers] at Infiniti of Cincinnati and Columbia Acura, well, they're more concerned with things like ""can I run it on regular?""

Maybe I need to seek out a better class of dweebs."
2364,benjaminh,March 2015,"markcincinnati: Your thoughts on the different cultures surrounding each make seem to me to be perceptive, funny, and mostly on target. Acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, I think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" Acura is in the midst of a renaissance, I believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more innovative. Its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there's a chance they could get closer. Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:

http://acurazine.com/

Even though Leonard Nimoy famously participated in an advertisement for Audi along with Zachary Quinto, which I imagine everyone here knows, in my mind Acura is the more ""logical and rational"" luxury brand. Perhaps for some Acura lacks passion at times, but as a long time Star Trek fan I somehow imagine that Mr. Spock might approve of some of their cars, as well as of their legendary reliability and longevity. And for passionate design I think there are few supercars more exciting at the moment than the new Acura NSX:

2365,markcincinnati,March 2015,"It amazes me how quickly KIA (and specifically the Genesis ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current Premium Class members a rude awakening. As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys.

I was surprised to see the number of questions some of these surveys contain that clearly indicate the Germans (or maybe it is just Audi, I dunno) are concerned that some Korean mfgrs are ""breathing down their necks.""

Now, I said that last bit for emphasis, but there has been at least a seed planted in the German mfgrs minds that says, ""The Koreans are Coming, The Koreans are Coming"" (and of course I immediately add -- mentally -- ""Cover yourself with butter and carry lemons just in case. . .!"")

But seriously, I saw some TV show on Velocity (I think) where a new Genesis (V8) was compared to a Mercedes E-Class and a Volvo S60. Now, at the time, before the video rolled, I thought, ""Whose dumbass idea was it to compare these three; they're not even close, no one would ever cross shop them?!""

Turns out I was wrong -- the Genesis, although not exactly a great handling car, has had its suspension tuned by Lotus (sorta) and the thing had a very powerful and smooooooth V8 hooked up to an 8-speed transmission (plus it had all of the latest and greatest electronic safety aids and toys the Germans keep loading their cars with.) Considering that this 2nd gen Genesis was in its first model year, I had to marvel at how far they've come and how fast they've done it.

I did think, too, Lexus was literally a trim-piece brand (and where are they now? First Place? or at least close to it) -- there weren't even any Lexi in Japan, they were all just called Toyotas. Now, look at Lexus -- a legitimate force to be reckoned with even if generally speaking some (OK most, OK, all) enthusiasts never have taken to them or seen them as anything more than sofas on wheels. Few, even the haters, laugh at Lexus now. And they actually brought that spunky little dude, the IS 350 F Sport to market and pantsed a BMW 335 (look it up, if you don't believe me.)

It would be hard to argue that both the top of the line Genesis, Equus and KIA cars aren't making ""don't look back, those headlights gaining on you are Korean"" type sounds.

So why isn't it possible for Acura to, likewise, kick butt and -- eventually -- regain some of its premium-ness? Of course, I don't KNOW, know, but I think, it is because they have found a niche where they have been and are successful, they make reliable and durable cars, their cars are in some pretty cool Marvel movies and the halo car has sex appeal. Have a cigar (and by the way, which one's Pink?)

By the way, I do think the NSX will be a great ambassador for the Acura brand, I just am not sure I see someone rushing in and buying an RLX based on the fact that the NSX wears an Acura badge. The gap between the NSX and the TLX or even RLX is unlikely to be narrowed by an oooober expensive sports car -- if you axe me.

Mean time, Genesis and KIA cars are quietly gaining ground and buzzing around the Premium Club members -- and you know what? Pretty soon one of them will sneak its way in and, then, well, there goes the neighborhood.

Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!

What next? Chrysler resurrects the Imperial?

2366,graphicguy,March 2015,"My track days are over. But, I still like a good handling car. I'm not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are. There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago). Just not so much any more.

These suspensions have become quite sophisticated. I do like the trick torque sensing rears of the Caddy, Audi, Acura. They truly allow rotation around any corner that really defies description.

I also like the current trend of tubo/supercharging smaller motors to get more power out of less displacement. I had a Saab turbo in the '80s. That one was ""hit the gas....wait for it....wait for it....BAM....steering wheel jerked out of my hand if I wan't holding on, and in the weeds you could go. Fun.....for about a week.

As for the Koreans usurping the German throne, I'd think that won't be a possibility for some time. Having said that, I recall a column I wrote several years ago where I noted that the Optima Turbo was a very nice car- and while it definitely was not a sports sedan, neither was an F10 528i.

I also draw a distinction between ""enthusiasts"" and those who are merely ""enthusiastic.""
The enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the NCAA Tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. There automotive counterparts are the owners with V6 Beamers; they think a port installed LSD is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don't have to remember how to open the hood..
In contrast, an enthusiast at the very least knows the engine configuration of his/her car as well as which wheels are driven- and hopefully understands a few rudimentary handling terms.

Sad to say, I have noticed that several more ""mundane"" marques are attracting an increasing number of true enthusiasts- if not rabid gearheads. BMW seems intent on casting a larger net while using ""bait"" that is becoming more and more bland.

There seems to be this rush by BMW, Infiniti (with the Q), Mercedes to move closer to the middle, or to cast a bigger net, as you aptly put it. Audi has stayed pretty true to the luxury sports sedan mantra. And, a brand like Cadillac seems intent on taking care of the space that was vacated. In all frankness, I probably would have gone back to BMW after all the foibles with my S4. But, they transitioned into the F3x by then, and the drive to me was much less engaging with them. Plus, to get what I wanted, the prices really have sky rocketed on them to approx a $7K-$8K delta between my 335ix coupe and the just released 435ix equipped about the same way. Thanks but no thanks.

I really have become smitten with the ride/handling engineering of the ATS/CTS. The Mag Ride Control is the real deal. Never thought I'd say soemthing the size of my CTS as ""flingable"", but it is. It's just one of those cars that I look forward to driving every day....even love the looks of it....the quality of it...the build of it.

Still, I would like to get some seat time in the new Mustang GT or the Challenger with the Scat Pack. Not sure when, or even if I'd buy either. But can't say never. Never is a long, long time. It would be a 2nd (3rd?) car if I did.

2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
2371,markcincinnati,March 2015,"Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW. I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW's have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!""

It seems, if memory serves, that the test reports demonstrated that the new BMW could better the old one in every significant (measurable) performance number.

Once again, since I am not, at this instant, in possession of the test report article, I could be mistaken. What I think I recall, however, is that despite the cries that BMW has forsaken the true believers, the numbers say otherwise.

I had been a die-hard manual transmission guy. Our Audis -- with the exception of my brand new 1997 A8 -- had always been manuals. My maxed out allroad (2003) had to be special ordered -- not that I probably wouldn't have anyway -- since the dealer simply did not stock stick shifts even back then. I couldn't believe Audi would simply no longer offer its cars with sticks (for the most part). The 2001 or 2002 A6 2.7T could be had with a stick but the same model with a 4.2 V8 was only offered with an automatic.

My wife's 2005 X3 had to be ordered, too, since there were virtually no X3's on the dealer's lot so equipped. As I recall we couldn't even test drive a stick BMW period.

When I got my 2005 A6, I knew I had probably enjoyed my last stick (the 2003 allroad 2.7T.)

Going on the hunt, I found that BMW did offer at least some stick shifts but there was little chance of finding one unless it was special ordered.

I now have a 7-speed DSG in my '14 S4. I, for the first time since 2003, don't miss the stick anymore.

Most people -- that I know, excluding my wife -- don't even know how to drive a stick, so I don't see much value in complaining about that, and, besides, the DSG is so much better at shifting than I ever was and the shifts don't feel like they're robbing power from the engine.

What we have today, if you believe Car & Driver (which I usually do), are better performing cars that have their performance characteristics available when you want them but invisible (for the most part) when you don't.

Yes, even Consumer Reports notes that an Audi [A6] is able to be sporty -- which I assume is somewhat of a statement that other brands (that they list) are not sporty.

I'm buying that today's fill in the blank (Audi, BMW, Mercedes & Porsche) automobiles are ""the best representations of sport sedans and CUV's ever on the market."" I'm, therefore, rejecting the notion that the old ones were better performers than the new ones. The fact that the brands have become more accessible to folks who don't think like I thought -- up until 2005 -- simply means the brands have the power to sustain themselves in the marketplace.

Even if I really thought a 10 or 12 year old M3 was somehow better than a new one, I am pleased that BMW has ""cast a wider net,"" for I fear had they not, they would be going or already have gone the way of the dodo.

The disdain so many have for sentimentality never ceases to amaze me -- my sentimental favorite car ever is my 1995 Audi S6 in pearl teal with a brilliant white leather interior. God I loved that car -- still have fond memories for it. It was, despite its being my favorite, no where near the car my 2014 S4 is -- the older S6 was, in perhaps every measurable way -- ""inferior"" to the new (or almost new) S4. My current S4 is the best car I have ever had, by a wide margin. I assume it would, in every measurable way, be crowned winna and champeen were it compared to the old S6 or even a last gen S4 (the one with the V8).

These cars that we talk about here and have strong opinions about are the best they have ever been (in every significant and measurable way). The fact that BMW or Audi now attracts folks who don't know that there isn't a V6 under the hood of their BMW is sad (for me at least); but, I would argue that the ignorant owner is just as desirable (as a customer) to BMW as the one who knows there is a turbo-charged inline-6 under the hood. In the end, car companies must put the soich for more money ahead of the soich for informed, appreciative and passionate customers. The way they go about selling more cars, however, is to build better cars that can be appreciated both by the true and pure disciples as well as the bourgeoisie.

Although I don't think the Koreans are TODAY too much of a threat to the world-order, I don't think we should dismiss them out of hand. They are making very rapid advances -- pretty soon they may find entry into the Premium Class (and by pretty soon I think we should be very watchful of the evolution of their products for the next 5 or so years.) I remember the first Toyotas that were imported (back in the 60's) -- made in Japan was, then, not much of a threat. It didn't take long until they were nibbling at US made market share, then they just started taking ever bigger bites until names like Toyota, Honda and Datsun were forces to be reckoned with.

I got into a new Genesis sedan -- it wasn't a Mercedes -- but honestly, I do think it was a very interesting attempt to convince ""you"" that it was worth a second look. Whenever the 3rd gen comes out, I would look for some serious suspension evolution which could go a long way toward making us take them more seriously."

It concludes:
the most significant change from the E90 to the F30 results from the switch to electric power-steering assist, which diminishes feel.

2373,markcincinnati,March 2015,"RB - No, The one I recall compared a new M3 to an old M3 (old being a relative term).

I do have a question - let's just say that the consensus of expert opinions favors the old over the new; what are consumers to do (assuming they want the car brand and model that has ""slipped"" during the transition from old to new)? If a 2009 BMW (or Mercedes, Porsche, etc) is superior to a 2015, many (perhaps most) consumers would still opt for the 2015 for reasons of reliability and durability (and factory warranty).

And, in the tests that I recall, the real performance differences between the old and the new are often only most noticeable above 8/10ths -- a place where few ever drive their daily drivers. So, even those who long for an E vs an F BMW or an Audi B7 vs a B8, etc, can't really go out and get a ""new"" E or B7; and, probably most of them want a 2015 not a 2008, 2009 or 2010.

I never had a V8 S4 -- and I'm told some were PO'd at Audi for changing to a super-charged V6. But I have nothing to compare my V6 T to in that regard, and hunting for a used S4 V8 is simply something I wouldn't even be interested in doing.

So the question is/stands: What can or will ""you"" (or the consumer) do? Seek out the ""better"" older version? Go to another brand? Take public transportation?

And, if newer models are actually better than the older versions and you just don't like the new ones, what will you do, boycott the company or fix and repair the old one until parts can no longer be found? Is moving to Cuba an option?"

I would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased.

I know the Audi brand better so hopefully this is a reasonable parallel:

The new Audi A3 -- even the S3 -- is not at all attractive to me. The new Q3, likewise, doesn't do it for either my wife or me. I'd bet even the eventual RS Q3 will not be attractive to us. Maybe it is the size of the A3, maybe it is that it seems a class lower in terms of the materials used throughout the interior. I would, therefore, assume if I were to acquire an A3, even the Prestige quattro version with the most potent turbo-4, I would be working hard to figure out how to ditch it at the first opportunity.

Come to think of it, it probably isn't the size of the A3 or Q3, it is just that it seems too much like it is an Audi-light vehicle (and I'm not speaking of it's curb weight.) The CLA Mercedes and the BMW 1 series, likewise just don't do it for me. My wife was loaned a 1 series (and it had the turbo i-6) BMW -- I drove it, very powerful, but it seemed, somehow, ""cheaper"" in the materials it was made out of. The Q3, which we had for a day and a half earlier this year, didn't have the cheapness issue I noted in the A3, but it was way, way underpowered -- it felt like a Tiguan (doh! it is a fancy Tiguan, after all).

All of our Audis have felt at least adequately powered, so the current Q3 seems like it was pulled out of the oven before it was done. Maybe I'll change that opinion once the regular Audi 2.0T engine is in place.

The $50,000 S3 was twitchy, like a go cart is twitchy, it was noisy at speed on interstate 275, where I drive every day in my quiet S4. The vast expanse of black plastic on the dash looked like something out of the rental fleet at Budget, not something that the sales person has to say with a straight face: ""we can sell this one for $47,900!""

So, you leased a left over BMW that was probably meant for a younger, earlier in their earnings arc, customer. You paid too little, got too little and were underwhelmed.

On the other end of the scale, you may have been equally unhappy with an Audi A8 -- or BMW 7 series. These cars are developed with input from design, engineering, marketing, production/manufacturing and of course, finance. When deciding what to do, I would imagine those in charge decide ""there is a target market for an X5, an X3 and now an X1."" There's also a market, a narrow market I would imagine, for the X6.

Those $70,$80 and $90,000+ 4-door German coupes from Audi and Mercedes are not marketed, I would assume, to a 23-year old with a freshly minted MBA from Ohio State or a 25-year old who just completed his/her JD from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.

Is the wider net a good thing to do? I probably would have said no a couple or three years ago, but maybe now, the market is such that these premium makers want to get them (the customers) early (aka ""young"") and make certain there are upmarket models ""within the family"" to aspire to.

My sales rep at the Audi Connection told me his wife wanted a new Audi Q3 -- he had to carefully market and sell his wife first AGAINST the Q3 and then move her thinking to the Q5 or Q7, stopping along the way at the A4 based allroad. Why? Well, the Q3 was ""not enough car"" for her as a Fortune 500 executive with three children aged from 12 to 15, a big dog (her husband) and a border collie. The Q3 would have been a fine choice about 14 years ago.

And this guy sells cars for a living -- no longer are car sales people ""order takers"" (if they ever were).

Hopefully you get my drift -- your expectations and your ""situation"" were not a good match for the leftover BMW you leased -- and it was a disservice to you to not shepherd you through the buying process. I think you weren't given what you needed to make an informed decision."

Sorry for the confusion in my post. I wanted to write a little more, but got called away from my desk while eating lunch (happens A LOT since my name's on the door). While the time I spent with the E90 328xi was brief, it was nothing short of amazing.

I had wanted a 3 series ever since I drove a friend's 1995 E36 328is 5MT through the streets of Buffalo late one night into early one morning. The car was just perfect. It fit me like a glove. At the time I didn't have too much stick shift seat time, but by the end of the night I was rotating the car car around corners.

I liked my Acura TSX that I inherited from my wife when we bought a Pilot to accommodate our upcoming 3rd child (she's 3 now), but didn't LOVE it. I saw an ad for leftover 2011 328xi BMWs, crunched some numbers, test drove the car, & fell in love. An inflated residual, $2000 in trunk money, 2 additional $500 payment credits, plus a $500 BMWCCA rebate gave me enough ammo to convince my wife that I want it & it makes sense (and cents).

My experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. Nice cars. Very smooth riding. I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. The chassis seemed to be stiffer. As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on. The car felt very disconnected.

Since BMW has moved into making their cars softer, they lost the edge they had over competitors like Lexus.

The scene at your BMW dealership on Saturday AMs is how things should be. Waxing poetically about their respective BMW. The truth is that inflated residuals, free maintenance, & low lease payments are what fuels the BMW brand.

As to your first question, I will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; I like the M235i but I balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the GTI, Miata, not to mention every V8 ponycar. The vanilla F10 and F30 leave me cold, regardless of their horsepower, and my opinion is shared by much of the US enthusiast press(remember when Automobile and Car and Driver were constantly accused of being biased towards BMWs? When is the last time a non-M model won a comparison test?). Now you are absolutely right; the wearers don't care, and Munich apparently no longer does either.
Fortunately BMW M is still cranking out decent cars. I think the new M3/4 is a return to form; I liked the E9x V8 but it drove like the true successor to my bitterly missed E24 M6- more a fast GT than a true sports car like the E46 M3. Ditto for the M5; the E60 V10 iteration was just a mess- the new car feels like it has a little E39 DNA spliced in.
I have no problem maintaining my 2 older BMWs- one thing BMW still does right is provide for older models; thanks to BMW Classic I can get virtually any part I need for my 1975 and 1995 BMWs at my dealer's parts counter. If it isn't in stock I rarely have to wait more than 2-3 days. And when I bring my 1995 Club Sport in for service I still get a loaner.

I have to admit that Audis and BMWs are beautiful cars, at least to me. They call out to me in a way few other cars do. MB, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. But looking at the reviews of the local Audi dealer just now I came across this:

""Currently have my Audi A4 in for repairs. It has 57,000 miles on it, and I will be walking out with a $5000+ repair bill. This is on top of $1500+ I spent on repairs in the last 7 months....""

Yikes! Acura stirs my emotions too, and part of that is the desire for reliability, durability, and low cost of ownership. If I want drama in my life I'll watch television or a movie. I don't need my car to give it to me lol!
I had a '98 Audi A4 and loved that car - V6 with a 5 speed manual. It was without a doubt the best driving car I have ever owned - smooth, sharp, and shifted like butter. But I got rid of it earlier than any other car I have ever owned - at 88K miles. It was already nickel and diming me with semi-expensive repairs - primarily a cooling system issue that the dealer couldn't seem to resolve but at $750-$1000 per visit while they kept replacing parts - thermostat, fan clutch, etc. So I finally and grudgingly sold it and bought my current ride, an '05 Acura TL (now at 150K miles). The Acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking TLs rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my A4.

My experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. Nice cars. Very smooth riding. I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. The chassis seemed to be stiffer. As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on. The car felt very disconnected.

2382,flightnurse,March 2015,"I'm gone for 2 days and this forum lights up...

First I laugh at people who criticize cars and brand after a short drive. Second, I pity the fool (in my best Mr. T voice) for criticizing cars without really driving longer then 1,2 or 8 days.

Lets look at the Geneses, Rick's Geneses has 65K miles on it, has only been in the shop for routine service. So basically flawless so far. So some of you say that people buy BMW's, MB's and Audi's because they want to prove something.. The Geneses is a very nice E class, for 2/3 the cost of a E class. I don't think anyone would say that the E class is a true sport sedan, and I wouldn't say the Geneses is one too, but after owning one for 3 yrs, I can say with fact that the Geneses is just as good as a MB E class or a BMW 528i (non line car.) Base price for those car's are 50K, a fully loaded Geneses can he had slight under 50K. The """"jittery"" suspension of the first Gen Geneses isn't a major issue, it's not a sport sedan and again it was never marketed as one. But if you were looking for a e class car, and price gave you a nose bleed, the Geneses was a great alternative.

Again on the comments about F3x, it's great people write reviews on these cars with limited real seat time, this doesn't make them ""experts."" Having 25K miles on mine, I have to say, this car has exceeded my expectation. This is why I'm looking at the F33 4 series Grand Coupe, I wish BMW would import the 435d, this would blend power and efficiency to a whole new level. But I'll take the 435i, however, when I'm ready to order my car it will be the 440i. Are the new F3x cars softer then the E series, yes, the ""true"" enthusiast can not keep BMW and Porsche in business so they had to do something to get a larger pool of people. I mean, for the people who buy the CPO cars, how does this keep the manufactures open? They don't, they keep the dealers open, it's the people who purchase new cars are the one who keep the manufactures open. I had always said, the E39 5 series was the perfect size car, and the F30 is slightly smaller then the E39. So BMW has been working on the EPS (elec power steering) to get the feel back, this would shut up some people. I just got back from a trip, slightly over 400 miles, I averaged 36 mpg, no one complained about cramp rear seats, and the ""numb"" steering wasn't an issue in which I couldn't control the car going up and down the mountain roads of southern AZ.

This is why Rick is getting a F34 328i GT, the car still has a very German ride to it, much more then his Geneses, the rear seats have more room then his Geneses and or a 5 series. Not everybody want a ride that is so stiff that there is a risk of losing their fillings. Since all GT's are xDrive, we are getting the Dynamic Handling Package this allows to have greater control in the x Drive cars when either the Sportline or M Sport lines are ordered (Rick is getting a Sportline GT.)"

2385,graphicguy,March 2015,"tlong....for a long time, it looked like the two of us were carrying the Acura banner. It's up to you now.

Actually, I may end up with another TLX sometime, but probably for my wife. Aside from the fact that I do believe they offer great value in the ELLPS space, they just don't break. And, they don't cost an arm and a leg to maintain. I do like the looks of the new TLX, but I also liked the previous version, too.

Driving my wife's Accord, and driving (albeit breifly) a new TLX, I can tell the differences immediately between the two. Most of it is underneath, though. SH AWD and some obvious thought given to the suspension in the TLX and sound deadening, it's a different and better drive in the TLX.

Not everyone will see it that way, though. They'll look a the dual screens on the dash and the motor similarities between the Accord and the TLX and declare the Accord to be the better value.

Accords are nice, sporty, mainstream cars that are cheap to own and fix. The Acura is all those things too. But, it handles better, rides better, steers better, has better materials inside and out. And, if you want, a torque vectoring rear in their SH AWD version. Can't get those things in an Accord.

Playing devil's advocate for a moment, a neighbor bouight an Accord Hybrid a few weeks ago. LOVES IT. Drives and handles like a regular Accord while getting 40 MPG. Impressive.

My wife is all about MPG. IF she doesn't get a TLX, it will probably be another Accord, but a Hybrid.

I get people not liking the styling of the TL. Personally, I did like it. I thought it was bold and unique, which suited me fine.

I've owned both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. TL SH AWD is mighty close to the Audi. No, the TL wasn't as fast as the S4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. It matched the S4 in the feature category. Service costs on the TL vs the S4 were miniscule in comparison. MPG was certainly better on the TL vs the S4, too. And, for the money I paid (under $40K) for the TL SH AWD Advance it offered huge value.

Don't get me wrong, I liked my S4. Didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the S4 and didn't like the MPG, nor the maintenance costs, either.
The S4 has been guzzling gas in the city/freeway traffic I drive in lately. I take short trips, lots of traffic lights, and I can see less than 20 MPG with my lead foot in the S4. I'm not happy about that, but I know it is possible to get 30 MPG in the thing if you maintain a constant high velocity over large distances, and I'm very happy about that.

Different driver, different results, but what kind of spectacular MPG did you get in your TL - SH AWD? To be fair, since the S4 is more powerful, it does tend to make a driver use that power more often IMO. More power = less fuel economy.

The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....

2016 ILX base
$27,900 msrp
0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D)
hp 201
trunk: 12.3
8 speed DSG
29 mpg comb

2015 Audi A3 1.8
$29,900 msrp
0-60: 6.5 (C & D)
hp 170
trunk 10
6 speed DSG
27 mpg

Each one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.

But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.

Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.

If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.

The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.

Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there.

Both are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX.
I think the 1.8 A3 is the lease special fleet queen badge buyer edition. Any car person in their right mind would pony up the extra $3K for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot. In other words, the 2.0T is better than the 1.8T in every measurable way except weight.

I know that makes the price gap larger, but that would be the more realistic comparison in my mind. Hey, I compared a TL-AWD to an S4 and opted to pay nearly $15K more for the S4.

I only wish I was so rich that speeding tickets and the financial penalty of them didn't bother me one iota. Of course, they would still bother me on principle, but it would be nice to just be able to hire a lawyer for 3 times the ticket cost to fight them for me on that principal rather than waste my own time.

As for A8's, I think a lot of buyers that drive them with no passengers get them for the Luxury and not the sport side of the equation. Lots of room for the driver, a cushy ride, and probably more sound insulation from the world than an A6 would offer. The ultimate side of luxury from Audi. However, if I had enough money for a dedicated sport/track car, I'd probably settle in on an S6 as my dream everyday driver (and I have one child).

Imagine if you had access to a great relatively lower cost Audi mechanic or two, that could have properly diagnosed the issues with your old A4 on the first attempt only replacing the parts that actually needed replacing!

2391,roadburner,March 2015,"markcincinnati- Mmy opinions pretty much align with this article, which essentially anoints the M235i as the true successor to the E46 M3- although I'm more than ""slightly annoyed that it’s not used on a broader range of the company’s products."" It's shrewd but cynical marketing on Munich's part, forcing enthusiasts to pay considerably more to get a car with traditional BMW driving characteristics. Even European drivers are unsure of which end their 1er is driven, so I suppose BMW figures why bother offering a better driving experience.

Another problem is that the competition has become much more intense as the playing field has leveled. It used to be that great handling, supportive seats, decent brakes, and an engaging powertrain were the exclusive province of the Europeans, but not any more.

For example, If I wanted an AWD performance car a BMW wouldn't be on my radar- a Golf R would be my likely choice, at least until the Focus RS arrives or Mazda offers their rumored AWD 300 hp MS3. While the M235i would be my choice if I wanted a great two door coupe, It's hard to ignore the S5, Mustang GT or 370Z NISMO which bracket the 2er at both ends of its price range. To each his own, but after 35 years of continuous BMW ownership I no longer many vehicles in their product line to be even remotely desirable...

As you say, by the time you fully trick out an A3 2.0 it's c. $42k. It's no doubt better than an ILX premium in many ways, but then again it should be at that price. For $42k msrp you can get an Acura TLX 3.5 V-6 with SH-AWD and the Advance Package, which has some features not found on the A3, plus quite a bit more room for passengers and cargo. Not everybody wants to pay $10-$15k more for a comparable ca, but Audis are no doubt great cars these days—in looks, performance, design, and features....

2395,markcincinnati,March 2015,"I don't know how it happened, but my wife's interest in cars these days seems to focus on horsepower and torque, all-wheel-drive, safety, handling capability (even if hardly ever tapped), some bells and whistles (but she thinks cruise control is the devil's own feature, refuses to use it) -- like blind spot monitoring, sat nav and voice commands for the phone and nav -- and, big wheels and tires (she has to have 20"" wheels and very wide, low profile Ultra High Performance All-Seasons).

Sure, she wants good gas mileage and a reliable and durable car -- all wrapped up in a vehicle that meets her definition of ""soul."" Her SQ5 (and, truth be told, probably a Porsche Macan) dots all the ""i's"" etc. Her Infiniti FX35 -- a car that I thought was very capable, even though it lacked a 354HP supercharged engine -- was very well built, was reliable for nearly 60,000 miles (so I can't speak to its durability) and despite its thrashy engine note, was pretty much fun to drive (if you could stand 16MPGs). Yet, her Infiniti and my Acura TL pretty much made her run, not walk to the Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo and VW dealers to find a CUV -- a high performance CUV. The 300HP X3 was good, the Volvo XC60 Type-R was good, too, the Mercedes M class, VW Toureg and Cadillac SRX all had merit. We even tried the top o' the line Jeep Grand both with and without the Hemi. The MDX and RDX were also tested and quickly rejected.

When we got to the 3,0T Audi Q5 there was a glimmer of hope -- and there we were torn between the Q5 and X3 -- until we test drove the SQ5. I've never seen $21,000 (the down payment on the $65K MSRP) exit the checking account more quickly -- I think the second test drive of the SQ5 sealed the deal.

Yet, some here have spouses (or significant others) who are all about gas mileage or roominess for kids, dogs -- and all the stuff that goes along with kids and dogs.

And, the good news is, we're all right -- the SQ5 is the best car, just as the MDX or the TLX or the 535 or the ATS or A4 quattro or even the lowly Accord -- all of these vehicles are the best for ""your"" circumstances and situations.

When we get to the ELLPS and LPS class of cars, we are well beyond the basics -- we're into vehicles that are helping us in their own ways to self-actualize. That is what it is about -- finding the car that today will help you self-actualize. I'd add, if your spending on a new car doesn't help you even in some tiny way to self-actualize, you've NOT chosen wisely.

One of the car magazines (Automobile perhaps, hell, I dunno, I subscribe to all of them for pity's sake), has a phrase they use ""No Boring Cars."" I think as we enter one of the later decades of life, we do actually start to believe ""now is the time to eschew 'boring' cars"" (and other things, but this is the place for cars, NOT for other things); we decide we can differentiate between an Impala and a CTS, we can appreciate a Panamera (even if we decide not to spend that much on a car).

I've really enjoyed reading all the posts here (well mostly), for example the ones about the upcoming trip to Germany to pick up the new BMW, the good the bad and the ugly S4 issues, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, so to speak.

I do enjoy the many perspectives y'all bring to the party here. I love it when this forum is active -- even when time doesn't permit my participation.

We are, if you axe me, in the golden age of cars -- almost limitless choice and hardly a klinker in the bunch.

I now have 23,000+ miles on my '14 S4 -- today I lust for an S6, tomorrow I'll instead hope for a new, slightly larger S4 to be unveiled. All the while, I am impressed every time I get behind the wheel of my current car. Reading your posts about your adventures in car shopping (and some mis-adventures) is great fun, often informative and from time to time frustrating.

Sorry to get so sentimental, but this forum is really a terrific outlet for those of us car enthusiasts whose appetite is larger than our bank accounts. It also has been, for me at least, a fantastic catharsis.

This is simple, because we can. Some of the new tech stuff is cool, what is really nice is cars today are rolling computers in which one could code a car to have these new techie stuff without paying for them.

Mark, why didn't your wife choose the Q5 TDI? better MPG and more torque then the SQ5, and a lower price point too. If I was going to get a SUV, it would be either the Q5 or X5d. Hard to bed 400lbs of torque and mid 30's MPG...
The SQ5 with the supercharged V6 is much quicker and the S treatment just can't be replicated from the option list.

The German SQ5 is a TDI -- now THAT would be the one. The US spec Q5 TDI is just not aimed at the customer who puts the performance Audi builds into its S cars first.

The only thing that she thought was a worthy competitor to the SQ5 was the Macan S (we didn't drive the Turbo -- and yes I know they're both turbocharged -- since it was way more money than we had planned to spend); yet similarly equipped the Porsche was some $10K more and it didn't even have pushbutton start and the design of the Macan made is have less utility.

An SQ5 TDI with an adjustable suspension and sport diff, now that would be something!"

It looks very nicely equipped at that price, including a power passenger seat, Bang and Olufsen Sound system, push button start, etc. It's not clear to me if this one has a back up camera at that price, but it doesn't list it.

Nice car!

For less money than that, however, I'd probably consider an Acura TLX with the Tech Package for about $3k less in msrp. For that you'd get navi, memory seats, a hard drive for music, LED headlights, more room, etc. , although of course your don't get the Audi 4wd, acceleration, or prestige.

Both are good choices, but serve different kinds of customers.....

For 2016 BMW has ""supposed"" to have fixed the ""numbness"" in the steering, it wouldn't be like the E46 or E90 but better then what the F3x cars have currently. I drive the 320 the way BMW has intended it to be driven, as a daily driver, and the car does this well. I love hearing people tear apart BMW's, these are generally are people who have no real seat time in them, as I posted driving one for a day or two isn't really real seat time.

I drove ""bare bones"" 328i multiple times, as loaners, each time it was for a couple of days (they always kept my car for service overnight), so I got about a week's worth of standard F30 328. Still don't care for the steering. Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension. Every time after those couple of days, or a test-drive of other 3-series derivatives in the market, including 335 or 435 (those were with MSport lines), I'm glad I can get back behind the wheel of my 328 wagon. It's not as fast, or fuel efficient, may be even a bit noisier, but the steering feedback feel is far superior. Why BMW changed it? Two reasons - fuel and market demand. The second one came from their desire to sell more and more units. The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income. Americans like things soft, I cru through tears every time I read those comments about ""such harsh"" suspension on sport package, they clearly never drove Audi, whose ""sport suspensions"" generally consist of stones in places of springs . But the steering was reporteadly ""too rigid"" for people - so BMW changed it. In America bigger and softer is still ""better"".

2412,graphicguy,March 2015,"BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either.

My 3rd gen TL was good, but a bit darty on the road. Fun to drive, though. The 4th gen TL (Acura Shield grill) added to the previous gen in big doses. It was more sophosticated, suspension was much better, it was faster, smoother....just all around better.

The current TLX I need more seat time in. But, it seemed to regress a bit over the previous version. Yes, it had all the tech....LED lights, shift buttons, 9 speed trans, quieter, plus it hit a price point with the 4 cyl that will appeal to many. But,, I came away thinking I enjoyed my 4th gen TL drive better.

I do think RB is right. There are driving enthusiasts who do know what their car can do and the specs of just about every important function of the car.

Then, there are those who just don't care. They just want a BMW or a Mercedes. They know what they're buying before they get behind the wheel of the test drive. They wouldn't know the difference between understeer or torque steer if you held a fire to their feet.

Not saying any of that is bad. Just think the majority of sales by the likes of the German brands have little to do with how engaging their cars are to drive. It has more to do with the perception of themselves by owning one of those brands.

Benjamin....the thing with a TLX, you'll not find a car with more tech in it on the road. It handles well (4 cyl and SH AWD versions). It's relatively quick. And, once you drive it off the dealer's lot, the only things you'll be back for is oil changes and tire rotations for most of its life. And if you do need something out of warranty fixed, you won't have to take a 2nd mortgage out. They get good MPG to boot. So, there's a lot to like.

TLONG....have you driven the new TLX yet? Might be worth it if you're actually starting to look. Although, I can't knock you for looking at something like the Mazdaspeed 3, however.

2413,markcincinnati,March 2015,"""We have met the enemy and he is us."" -- Pogo.

I agree with the following statement made here by one of our fellow posters:

""The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income.""

What I sense here, however, is that ""average Joe"" is meant to imply someone who, due to their lack of sophistication, and due to their sheer numbers has been at least partially responsible for the degradation of the ""essence"" of BMW automobiles (at least the 3 series apparently) ride and handling characteristics. Somehow I get the feeling here that I (we) am (are) meant to hold ""average Joe"" accountable and to blame for the sorry state of current BMWs steering and ride/handling characteristics.

What BMW did was realize, apparently, that it is better to be popular with respect to your target market rather than attempt to appeal to what some have called the lunatic fringe. If you are the CEO, what is your charge? I would argue it is to first retain market share then to gain market share. If your loudmouth customers won't put their money where their mouths are, do whatever it takes to find the customers and prospective customers who will.

Why is it so difficult, virtually impossible, these days, to find manual transmission cars? If you read what I read, you would think manuals are the best way to go if you want the best performance possible. Were I an auto manufacturer's CEO, and I read these posts and virtually all of the automotive enthusiasts magazines, I would start making stick shifts available all across my car lines. I would spend time and treasure to make certain my brand would offer stick shifts and that my dealers would be required to keep stick models in stock.

My company would suffer, because as Pogo says, ""the enemy is us"" [sic]. All of us loudmouths who want stick shifts (based on our bellyaching) were all yak and no shak! Stick shifts aren't popular, they don't sell and if I listened to the lunatic fringe, my car company would die on the vine.

Stiff suspensions and steering that offers road feel don't increase sales, in fact they must actually decrease sales or they would dominate.

It is possible to order an Audi A6 with a sport suspension, ultra low profile tires and 20"" wheels -- and those tires would be max performance designation and be made of short tread life summer only compounds. You would think the benefits of the lower stiffer suspension calibration thicker anti-roll bars and the above mentioned tires and wheels would be so obvious that dealers couldn't keep A6's so built in stock.

The reality is, the very few sport suspension equipped models are the slowest sellers. Pogo strikes again.

I say we all need to go out and BUY the 3 series all tarted up with every performance enhancing option possible, ditto the Audi, Cadillac and Mercedes (and other brands) models.

We need to shut up, grow up and pay up -- the cars you're (me too) bitchin' about are the way they are because of YOU. If you had forced the issue and actually put your money where your mouth is, well we'd have great performing BMWs (and the others, too) instead of the cars so many of us decry as ""not what they used to be.""

The way they used to be is not responsive to the market.

2414,graphicguy,March 2015,"Mark....bravo.

I have a little bit of a different view on a couple of points. Manual transmissions......frankly, I doubt there's anyone on this board that can shift faster than the current crop of autos. That's why we've been seeing performance numbers that are higher for autos than they are for automatics. Same goes for MPG (which isn't a ""nice to have""....gov't is making big MPG numbers a necuessity).

Personally, I'd rather have a 4 on the floor big block to carry me around. Efficient? Not hardly. Heavy and unwieldy? Yep...pretty much. But, that's what I'd like.

Point being, to gather market share, the BMWs, the Mecedes, the Infinitis, etc are all moving towards the middle. ""Let me have my 3-pointed star or my roundel, so I can get noticed. The rest? Performance? Handling? Who cares? That's not why I bought this car."" Those are the customers in this segment, now.

OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions. For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now.

Sure it is possible that a product (and a car is a product) from 2000 or 1996 or even 2012 is superior in some way or many ways to a 2015 model. Overall, it is my belief that as time passes the products generally improve either by being more effective or more efficient or both.

The thing is, somebody writes (while obviously wringing their hands) how they're so very very disappointed in the (speaking of automobiles) fill-in-the-blank's appearance, engine, transmission, seats, sound system, nav system, fuel economy, wheels, tires, brakes, headlights, tail-lights, side-lights, and on and on and on until I could just scream.

If, for instance, you don't care for the Audi A4 2.0T (insert trim level and options here) because it has a 4-cylinder engine and a tinny sounding audio system and flat, non-supportive seats, well I would counter with either: Don't buy one or Option the thing up the way you want it including getting an S (and in some cases RS) model. Audi and BMW (again, to name just two) provide customers with extensive optional (or ""available"") configurations.

""The 'old' 3-series was better?"" Better than what? I would argue you can option the 3-series to provide the looks (within reason), performance, handling, creature comforts, etc, that will allow you to have it your way.

Miss the i6 engine of yesteryear? Can't see yourself driving anything less than a vehicle with 6-cylinders? Get a 335. Better yet, get an M3 and stop being such a cry-baby. Me? I had to settle for an S4 with a 7-speed DSG transmission with a very nice B&O sound system and blind spot monitoring to say nothing of beautiful red leather seats. You'd think I'd gone daft were I to tell you my 1996 5-cylinder S6 was seriously a ""better"" car (even though it is a sentimental favorite).

Have to have a stick shift? -- well maybe you can maybe you can't get one in the particular fill-in-the-blank you want; but, as has been correctly noted above, today's dual clutch automatics and even torque converter equipped 8-speeds can and will out-shift Walter Röhrl on his best day -- do you think you can do better? (and besides the reason there are no stick shifts has already been explained and it is still YOUR fault).

The car you want in this era of virtual mass-customization probably does still exist. If you have to have analog steering with hydraulic assist, well, you'll probably have to buy a used car that may not have as many improvements as the 2015 or 2016 that you can buy off the lot, or better still order direct from BMW (or whoever).

Yes, yes, we should and hopefully will be permitted to continue, letting of steam: Wishin' and Hopin' for the good ol' days.

Gawd, some of us (and you know who you are) sound like my parents when I wanted to listen to the Beatles or Led Zep (or, heaven forbid, Pink Floyd): ""That's not music, its a bunch of barbarians, barbarians I tell you. Now Lawrence Welk, THAT's music Mark!""

If you (and you know who you are) just can't take the direction BMW is going, find something else and buy it. What I am concerned about (and often representative of) is our becoming a bunch of curmudgeons or maybe even Luddites.

Buying a 2005 fill-in-the-blank because that was the last year the arbitrary capillary was still used to keep the pressure evenly applied to the crank-knuckle, doesn't do anything for the advancement of the art and science of the automobile business (and we mustn't forget it is first and foremost a business).

All I am asking is that you (we) don't adopt my dad's approach to rock music in your descriptions of your disappointments with BMW or Audi or even Acura for abandoning us, the faithful -- dear old dad used to say this about rock music: ""Noise, Bohemian tripe, bang and twang over-loud, barbarians at the gates of hell!""

It gave me such great pleasure when I came home (from my first quarter of college) for Thanksgiving having gone without a haircut for nearly 5 months and blasting (I turned it up to 11):

""You need cooling

My '14 Audi doesn't have a cassette player!

I can, however shift my DSG with greater precision than I could ever shift a stick shift, and I was (and hopefully still might be) good at shifting.

But, it still doesn't matter -- ""no one"" buys them. I did test drive both an S4 6-speed manual and the DSG I ended up getting -- the DSG (shhh don't let this out) was better at it than I and, at high RPM's, the DSG never made a misstep and didn't require me to drive with one hand on the wheel.

I drank the Kool-aid apparently.

And, although I could have gotten my S4 with a stick, the S3, perhaps foreshadowing other coming attractions, can only be had with a 6-speed DSG.

Even my wife's 8-speed tiptronic has been programmed by folks so skilled, it seems like it MUST be a DSG, too.

I don't know about durability, but I imagine I might find out this time, since I plan to keep the thing beyond the factory warranty (but I have been thinking I would buy an extended warranty, cover myself with butter and carry lemons just in case.)

Yet, another argument that ""they're"" hoping ""we'll"" make is that we'll want to keep our vehicles as up to date as possible; and since most cars can't be updated to adopt the latest and greatest technologies, the notion of replacing cars about every 3-4 years does have some merit."

TLONG....have you driven the new TLX yet? Might be worth it if you're actually starting to look. Although, I can't knock you for looking at something like the Mazdaspeed 3, however.
Actually have not driven either yet. If I were to buy Acura again I would get the ILX as I've had the TL for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - I want it a bit smaller. So no TLX, plus I'm not in the mood to spend that much. I certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$.
-
I looked at the specs - I would pay probably $5K more for a ILX than a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan. The Mazda has things like HUD, blind spot warning, even radar cruise control, all around $30K tops. It is a small bit larger than the ILX. It is widely praised as being like a baby BMW in handling. I know that in our '07 Mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current TL by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. I would expect the current Mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.

The ILX on paper is a little smaller. Given my TL experienc, I'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the Mazda, which is a consideration. The ILX has more HP but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel. And am still considering getting a manual if I could find either of them in that tranny, since they are both still offered with manual transmissions.

The other alternative is just hanging onto my '05 TL a few more years.

Actually have not driven either yet. If I were to buy Acura again I would get the ILX as I've had the TL for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - I want it a bit smaller. So no TLX, plus I'm not in the mood to spend that much. I certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$.
-
I looked at the specs - I would pay probably $5K more for a ILX than a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan. The Mazda has things like HUD, blind spot warning, even radar cruise control, all around $30K tops. It is a small bit larger than the ILX. It is widely praised as being like a baby BMW in handling. I know that in our '07 Mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current TL by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. I would expect the current Mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.

The ILX on paper is a little smaller. Given my TL experienc, I'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the Mazda, which is a consideration. The ILX has more HP but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel. And am still considering getting a manual if I could find either of them in that tranny, since they are both still offered with manual transmissions.

The other alternative is just hanging onto my '05 TL a few more years. It stays reliable at 150K, still looks good and drives well, I put a few $$ into it occasionally for battery/tires/brakes/fluids/etc. I did get the engine mounts and some suspension bushings changed at about 137K and spent about a grand. I figure that is ok given the mileage and it was my most expensive repair on the car.

I didn't know you could option up a Mazda3 all the way to 30k. But I went to their site and you're right--it can be done. Since the Acura ILX starts at 28k msrp, depending on the options you want you could have an ILX for less than a fully tricked out 3. In terms of size, the two are very close. In fact, the ILX and the 3 are within about an inch of each other in length and width.

The Mazda 3 with the 2.5 is rated by the epa at 32 mpg combined, which is a big jump from the 21 of your 2005 TL. But the ILX does pretty well at 29.

In terms of acceleration, at least according to Car and Driver, the ILX is about a second faster going to 60 than the Mazda3 2.5. ILX: 6.3 ; Mazda3 2.5: 7.3. To me it seems like a possible case for the ILX, but since I haven't driven either one I don't know about driving enjoyment.

The 2016 ILX is no longer available with a manual. The standard transmission is an 8 speed DC with an exclusive torque converter. It does come with paddle shifters...

Mark....Are you a Miami alum? I am. Are you talking about WOXY?
Yes I am a Miami Alum, too and actually a Miami Merger -- got my undergrad and grad degrees from MU, worked at WOXR (not OXY) as the program director, commercial producer and had an on-air show 5 nights per week. We WERE for about 6 years the only prog rock station in SW Ohio. Those were the days. OXford Radio (OXR). I have no idea why the name was changed to OXY.

When I went to Miami, no cars were allowed unless you were married or until you were in grad school, so car commentaries weren't even on my radar. Actually did my Master's work (which used to be called a thesis, but by the time I was there it was called ""independent reading"" which was, so it seems, about 10x the amount of work as just taking a class would have been -- I mean I felt like I read the entire freaking library for pity's sake) on how mass-media (when there was no Internet) helped win World War II financially by getting people to buy the bonds that funded the thing. And, in 1976, your final act before getting your Master's was what was then called Master's Orals. As far as I know these days if you take and pass the courses you get the degree. Back then (1976, before you were born probably), you had to sit in front of three PhD's and the Dean and answer their questions and spar with them for about 90 minutes or so, so they could determine if you knew your subject matter. Probably helped that I was a DJ since talking was how I made my living (such as it was) at the time.

When I was new to trips to Germany, I would take every opportunity my wife would permit to go into Audi dealerships. I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich. I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom.

One trip, I went to the new Audi dealership that is at the Munich airport -- I asked the rep why no inventory? He told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. Almost every Audi (and BMW) that we've had since 1978 have been special order cars. I always thought if you're going to spend ($50K+ in today's $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money. Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?

The 10th (so they say) largest BMW dealer is here in Cincinnait. We have two Audi dealerships, two BMW, three Mercedes, two Porsche, etc etc, stores in our Big Town (almost a small city). I have, many times, attempted to find THE car I wanted in stock -- ""can't be done!"" My most recent Audi was $57+K and my wife's SQ5 was $65+K. At what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60K car that is ""sitting on the lot?""

I wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather. I also wanted all-season OEM tires. My wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while I wanted white. I would've probably taken the metallic white Audi offers, but I was very specific in what I wanted as was she.

What I can't imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted. I took my 2012 Acura TL with a black leather interior -- a color I said I would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted. What was I thinking? That fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.

So, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.

Ordered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory. The reason? The dealer doesn't have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in. Floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.

When I see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be shuttled to the location of the car you're going to look at -- I assume someone has to pay for that, and I assume it will be the customers.

The tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you're looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the TV commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid. Sometimes, Small really is Beautiful."
2439,graphicguy,March 2015,"Mark....like you. many times I've bemoaned the fact that the BMW dealers just seem to carry the ""middle of the road"" colors and options on their cars. My BMW dealer (Sweeney) is a little bit better than the other place as far as having stock that meets my wants closer. But still, it's a struggle to find exactly what I want.

As you noted, the two Audi stores are even worse. Mercedes dealers seem to be a bit better, but I'm not really a fan of their cars. So, outside of helping my sister buy one, and the cursory looks I give them when I'm shopping, I can't mention whether their stock situation is good or not.

I know whenever I've become frustrated with the selection when buying a BMW, my long time sales associate is more than willing to order something. I never have. But, depending on their cycle of ordering, he's said it takes between 4 to 6 weeks from ordering until I'd be picking it up.

I can see the allure for the dealership. No floor plan to pay. It's pretty much a guaranteed sale, getting exactly the car YOU want. And, price is agreed up front (or at least it should be).

I've been to one of the Porsche dealers. Like their cars, but the dealership acted like I was invisible. I passed by two sales offices where the sales person looked up to see me, and ignored me. I passed two in the showroom who wouldn't even make eye contact.

2441,dino001,March 2015,"Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?

That's what I say. I think same principle applies even to much cheaper cars. Considering that they are often even bigger portion of buyer's income (i.e. price of Ford Focus is most likely higher percentage of their buyer's income than those buying new 3- or 5-series; not always, but more often than not).

I never understood American ""have to have it today"" culture. Ironically, the need for instant gratification, today considered a ""core American value"", is a far departure from thrift and patience were virtues preached by the first settlers, but that's another story. As I was saying many times before, part of my attraction of German brands to me is the real ability to get something that's in the catalogue. The salesmen never complain, never roll their eyes, or repeatedly attempt to sell you what's there here and now. I consider a single proposal acceptable, what I hate is a hard push against clearly expressed customer's wish. Many other brands have ""phantom"" configurations, options and packages that can be specified together as ""available"", but not really available - not just not in stock, but simply not possible to get, even with waiting. When ask, you get this blank stare, like you just arrived from another planet. Some dealers would pretend to take an order and then try to fit what they have in the pipeline. Two months later, you get a phone call: there is one coming, just your color and option X, but it has a sunroof that you didn't ask for, is that OK? I've seen that too many times.

My only beef with German brand dealers, is that there are some options that truly change the car's characteristics, but not available in stock. Case in point - BMW 3 and 4 series have this adaptive M-sport suspension, which may or may not be a good thing. It is the only way to get a sport suspension on their AWD models, where Sport and M-Sport lines are only decorative aesthetic options (as opposed to RWD models, where sport suspension is added). I'm still yet to see any car in stock with that option. So should I want an X-drive car (e.g. wagon or GT models comes only with that that), I'd like to know how that adaptive M-sport suspension would work, if it's worth that extra thousand bucks, or not. I can't. Well, I'll live, I guess. Most likely I'll get RWD 4-series with Sport Line, anyway.

I think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars. As you may know, Europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles. I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there. At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger. Rather than three engines, you get something like eight. Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options. Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books. We enjoy lower price at expense of choices, limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture. They can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege. To each their own, I guess.

BTW, there are similar market differences in electronics. When I was first buying some audio equipment (long time ago), I was struck how little choice was there in a big box store, despite all that square footage in comparison with a typical European store, especially in ""above entry level, below upscale"" category.

2447,markcincinnati,March 2015,"When we ordered my wife's two X3's we did order the sport seats, the sport steering wheel, etc -- we also got sport wheels with +1"" wheel size and wide and lower profile tires.

Two things struck me:

#1 if you get the package with the sport steering wheel, you can't have the wheel heated.

#2 no matter what ""sport"" option you selected, there was nothing that changed the calibration or ride height -- i.e., there was no sport suspension. The best you could do to sport the thing up was the bigger wheels and tires, which do help somewhat -- but the overall suspension is the same with or without the sport options.

Audi has a package they call ""SLine"" that is or was available -- and it did (on the A4 at least) offer sport seats, +size wheels and tires and lower ride height, stiffer springs, struts and thicker anti-roll bars (front and reat). Sometimes they even included a special steering wheel but they did include paddle shifters too when one ticked off the ""SLine"" option.

I see the A6, too, can be had with an all season or summer only sport package which does alter the suspension to ""sport"" calibration.

According to the special brochure, Audi's S cars have ""special S tuned"" suspensions which I believe our friends over on AudiWorld.com say is different from the sport package offered on the A4 and A6.

Why BMW chose NOT to offer a sport suspension on their X-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.

Tires contribute to the cars handling, doh!, you already knew that. So, here is something you can do that you may find has value to you. When you order a new Audi S4 with the all-season tire option, it comes with 18"" wheels and 40 series tires. The optional tire package comes with 19"" wheels and 35 series tires.

The all-season tires are H rated grand touring Continentals or other Name Brand all-season tires. When you graduate to the 19"" wheels, the tires are Z rated (at least) and could be Continentals -- but they are MaxPerformance tires.

The difference, here in America, at least is that the Continental tires are ""good,"" but unless kept inflated to at least 42 pounds, they are built for comfort, not for performance. Why Audi chose H rated tires is beyond me.

When ordering the 19"", the tires are summer only rubber that helps the car go like a snake in a rat hole when compared with the H rated grand touring rubber.

So, what you can do, if you are an American who doesn't need or won't swap out tires twice per year, is go ahead and get the all seasons that come with the thing and upgrade (it is called +Zero) to a wider, lower profile Ultra high performance tire that will fit on the 18"" wheels -- or you can keep the same size tires but get UHP all-seasons. The difference is not subtle -- the car's willingness to turn in is cranked up to 11, it then really does go like a snake in a rat hole, and you won't be obliged to swap out your tires semi-annually.

Here's the deal, I THINK: European manufacturers, attempting to cater to American tastes, try to err on the side of comfort, quietness and durability beyond 25,000 miles. In doing so, I think they go too far. Why would Audi (for example) put H rated Grand-Touring tires on an ""S"" (not SLine) vehicle? I replaced ours with W rated UHP DWS Continentials (all season, Dry Wet, Snow), inflated the fronts to 43 and the rears to 41 -- transformation!

With virtual mass customization the norm these days, why not offer Grand Touring, All-Season Ultra High Performance and Summer only Maximun Performance tire options on the order form and be done with it?

Or at least think: BMW ""M"" is supposed to be more than an emblem or decal, more than trim and bling; likewise ""S"" (for Audi) is supposed to be a special version of a given Audi model, that includes sport: seats, exhaust, suspension, steering wheel and pedal covers, AND (one would think) TIRES. Somehow both Audi and BMW have an incomplete circuit somewhere that seems to prevent the inclusion of all of the required ingredients that go along with the notion of a ""sport model"" designation.

I had a similar conversation at my dealer when I got the ATS. Their response was almost identical. All they tend to bring in are black, white and silver cars with black interiors. Very rarely will they bring in a vehicle without a black interior regardless of exterior color. It is bizarre.

2451,markcincinnati,March 2015,"White is the new black. According to our BMW store white is the most popular color. Black and silver are also popular.

White and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by European mfgrs. My wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called Panther Black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears BLACK from a distance of over 10 feet.

I used to special order Pearl White on all my Audis. Then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and Pearl White became a member of the Special Order collection that Audi offers to anyone who will pony up the money. It is called Audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- ANYTHING -- starts at $2,500 -- why? Because they can.

In 2009, I wanted the Ecru (Cardamom) interior color and it only came with blonde wood -- I thought the contrast wasn't there, I wanted the burl walnut wood inlays. At that time, $2,000. Despite the fact that I had custom ordered the A4 Pretige with most every option listed, I just couldn't bring myself to pay $2K for something that was no charge had I not wanted the Cardamom leather. Next year blonde was dropped in favor of the dark walnut.

Much as I favor an almost the sky's the limit, I just can't see something like I have just described as anything other than an option from our ""shameless profit collection.""

BMW seems to charge breathtaking prices for wheels that aren't part of the two or three ""normal"" choices offered -- I know there are certainly differences that justify higher costs, but there was an X6 on the showroom floor with a $5,000 wheel package (tires were another upcharge).

I know a lot of options are outrageously priced, but at least it would seem they kind of bury the charge so that the price gouging isn't obvious.

Now I'll show my ignorance -- the last time I priced an Infiniti, their color palate was ""included"" in the MSRP base. This included both pearl and just clearcoat colors.

I'm the guy who would probably pay MORE for the basic car if all the paint choices were ""included"" -- it just galls me to see $1,075 for an admittedly pretty black color. It is good that I actually prefer white, cause were they to start charging extra for gloss white, I'm sure I'd scream ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!""

Why BMW chose NOT to offer a sport suspension on their X-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.


They do - it's called M-Sport Adaptive suspension, sold together with variable sport steering as Dynamic Handling Package priced at $1000 for 3- and 4- series. On X3, they're selling same name package with somewhat different content.
One thing I like about the DHP on the X SAV's is they are more rear wheel bias when having fun and once slip is detected then more power goes to the front wheels. Not too sure if this is true on all X-Drive cars..."

White is the new black. According to our BMW store white is the most popular color. Black and silver are also popular.

White and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by European mfgrs. My wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called Panther Black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears BLACK from a distance of over 10 feet.

I used to special order Pearl White on all my Audis. Then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and Pearl White became a member of the Special Order collection that Audi offers to anyone who will pony up the money. It is called Audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- ANYTHING -- starts at $2,500 -- why? Because they can.

My sentiments exactly; I've owned 10 BMWs-from an E24 M6 to an E83 truck-over the past 32 years and I completely agree that upwards of 99% of the new Bimmers don't offer nearly enough performance to justify their premium price- particularly when you have to pay for ""options"" that come standard on many much less expensive cars(See: HIDs, enhanced Bluetooth and USB connectivity, decent ICE, EHP summer tires, heated seats, etc., etc.).

""There are a lot of really good cars (as good or better than BMWs) at price points that are much less""

Which???
The problem I have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.

Furthermore, my issue with most of these cars -- but the Germans top the list of offenders -- rears its head because I typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.

A base (good luck finding one) Audi S4 is hard to beat -- but I wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, B&O sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the list goes on. There is no way the technology we (or I) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500. Hell, I can buy a 75"" Samsung HDTV for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.

So, yeah, there are very good cars at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is BETTER than a BMW or an Audi or a Mercedes, etc, but there are a lot of comparable cars IF POPULARLY equipped. My car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and I didn't even get a Prestige model.

The base fill in the blank German fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the German car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.

Now, having said that, I will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. I do, to this very day, believe that the Acura TLX SH-AWD with the Advance package (and ONLY that configuration) is Acura's S4. And, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. Yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the Acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate. But the TLX's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.

So, I complain about the price of the S4 vs the TLX (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but I still put down the extra $6K-$12K for the Audi BECAUSE I test drove it.

How many of them are RWD and come with a manual transmission?
At the risk of getting myself in hot water: NONE, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior AND preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with.

And, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of consumers (again for mere mortals), AWD no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the AWD version passes the RWD or FWD version. Ask Porsche, to name one, what cars they market are AWD -- the low performance or high performance variants?

I can appreciate RWD and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ELLPS car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.

The reasons are well documented and even if I did think RWD and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans cars rule and AWD is in very widespread use, often in the cars touted as THE highest performance versions.

The sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity. I would assume if BMW thought it could overwhelm Audi by building and selling FWD cars exclusively with manual transmissions, I would assume they would do so.

A dead purist is still dead, after all. Companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and AWD cars or at least the option to add AWD is well on its way toward total market dominance.

I like being alive -- but, in my case at least, I actually think auto trans AWD vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today. So I think I am a purist, just one who thinks RWD (or FWD) and stick shifts are so 1980."

It is funny. You and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to options. I think cars are really expensive to begin with. So I choose my options carefully. If I'm going for a BMW, then its going to have the lighting package, backup camera, heated seats, AWD, & a slush box. That's it. My former E90 328xi was loaded up with options that didn't really add that much to the driving experience. Sure the leather seats were really nice & the sunroof let light into its black interior. The Navigation got me 95% of the way to my destination.

Now I definitely like the way sport package equipped cars drive and look. Nowadays they are really expensive option packages that come with low profile, run flat tires that can get expensive, especially around here.

2470,graphicguy,March 2015,"WE have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions. Yeah, they are fun. But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual. Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price. Yes, you can special order them. But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one. They're out there. They're a acarcity, though.

Even something like a Mustang GT or Camaro SS are tough to find in a manual trans. They're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.

I think most of the trade rags give the nod to the Cadillac ATS when it comes to 3 Series, A4 etc comparisons. I've driven an ATS, several times. They are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range. Good looking and built well with great materials, too.

I agree with Mark....on the upper end of the ELLPS range, probably the S4 could arguably be preferred over the others. Audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at Edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate. Still, can't argue its performance.

Acura TL SH AWD Advance? Boy....I would have a hard time justifying $50K-$60K for a 3xx ix or A/S4, C300/400 4 Matic if I were looking for a level of performance, comfort, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what I paid for mine ($38K and change). I don't have enough seat time in the TLX SH AWD to really render a judgement. But, for $45K list for the advance package, the same applies to it.

If it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, I would have had a Lexus is350 F sport gracing the GG estate right now. It's a lot like the Acura TL. It doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in ALL categories. At the time, I could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47K, too. It's design could be polarizing, too. But again, being the ""odd ball"" I am, likeing the TL's previous design, I liked the Lexus' design, too.

I understand people being polarized by the styling. But, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity, sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance. They are a LOT of car for that kind of money.

So, are their better cars out there than the 3 Series? From my perspective, yes....lots of them. My reasons may be different than yours, though. You start loading one up to knock on the $60K+ door, and that list grows dramatically.

They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature. WE'VE killed manual transmissions. We're about to kill driving altogether. See my next post."
2472,markcincinnati,March 2015,"In·ev·i·ta·ble: unable to be avoided, evaded, or escaped; certain; sure to happen.

Our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about RWD, FWD, AWD, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. These discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous cars.

With google, Apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time frame in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation. By that I mean we’ll have individual containers (cars) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train. You’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.

It probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming. It’s coming pretty quickly too. Insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it. You’ve (or perhaps, better said, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. Just this morning, coming into work, I passed a driver of a late model Mercedes S class – the driver was on the phone! There is no way this Mercedes doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated Bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. Now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous cars?

Well, as I am willing to say, I am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car. But, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving. We probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone. Even my Audi offers in-car Wi-Fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity. So what do “we” do? Rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that distracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. This is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since I know that an ever increasing number of cars have Bluetooth as standard equipment.

Inevitable? Yes. While growing up, my parent’s cars never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new Chrysler Newport. It did not come with seatbelts. The dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). I never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. As time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.)

We can, in the name of safety, list all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another list of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. These two lists, with descriptions, would fill volumes.

These days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300HP motor and put it in a lightweight body. And they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. Even 350HP, 400HP or 500HP are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. Likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. When 0-60MPH can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60MPH, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and distracted drivers crash and burn.

The response? Intervention. Police intervention? Sure, but often that is after it is too late. What is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. First came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability programs, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear distances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. Then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. Infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the Q50. Google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a Mercedes S-class; and recently an Audi A7 (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the Nürburgring. Look ma, no hands!

Recently, I have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from Pogo, “We’ve met the enemy and he is us.” Now, without mirth, I re-invoke the saying and once again, I blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving. I blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane pilot’s license.

If we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. Yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.

I – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous cars, because driving on our I-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and I include myself) is just too much Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress). I have this wonderful 333HP sporty sedan and I drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard I try to maintain one car length for every 10MPH) and at about 47MPH (or less, truth be told). The hell of it is, I live in Cincinnati – have you ever been here? This place is barely a city for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated. I can only imagine the frustration of having an S4 in Chicago or Boston or Dallas. Hell yes, gimmie a car that I can program to my destination, push or say “engage,” meanwhile I work on my iPad mini catching up on my [State Department] emails and other mi·nu·ti·ae: The small, precise, or trivial details of something.

At least if I’m in my car, not having fun driving it, I can be in my car not having fun but at least being somewhat productive.

2474,markcincinnati,March 2015,"My wife calls the differences between her last car, an Infiniti and my last car, an Acura, a lack of soul. I understand that she probably means something that is there but very difficult to quantify -- it can't be measured and written down, that is.

I did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 TL (most especially the audio system -- I still have the DVD-Audio discs), were I to even attempt to characterize what I could articulate differentiated the TL vs the S4, it would start with a sense that the Acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors. The Audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no clicking or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking. The Acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. The very comfortable, heated and ventilated seats, in the Acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wobbling. I don't know if I would call the Acura's feel something as negative as ""OK fit and finish,"" perhaps I would simply call it ""less solid"" feeling than the Audis (or BMWs) we've had.

If that equates to soul (my wife's term, remember), well there you have it. Please remember I am not saying I think the Acura is not a good car, a very high value car, a fully-featured car with lots of impressive technology. I also thought the SH-AWD with the 19"" wheel tire package made the TL elicit a sense of deja vu -- like it was, somehow, related or at least relate-able to an S4.

I, at age 63, now think life's too short (for me, at least) to drive an Acura TL or TLX when there are cars like the S4 on the market.

Thanks, but I did know that it is possible to get the BMW you mention (as well as several Audis, etc.) with a manual. The point that I was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales? They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature. WE'VE killed manual transmissions. We're about to kill driving altogether. See my next post.
Mark, Audi does not built a RWD drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does MB, Infiniti or Lexus. I agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. The 8 spd in my 320i with the coded Sport Transmission is a great unit, I can cruise in comfort and not feel it shift, or if I want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, I push the toggle switch to Sport, and if I want to push it harder, I'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into Sport+. Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)

When people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my EX and I had a couple of classic cars, he had a 57 Continental Mark II (Please do not call it a Lincoln Continental) and I had a 70 Olds 442 Convertible W30 and a 70 Mustang 302. The Olds was the classic A body car. Yes, it was fast but not really THAT fast, the Mustang was quick, faster then the Olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as cars in the late 90's, and lets talk comfort, the Olds was an Auto, the Mustang was a stick, the clutch on the stang was SOOOO stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. The Continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... Even the Olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. So when I hear people talk about the good ole days of cars and how good they are, I just laugh.. Give me a 335i with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle cars. Even the 2015 Stang GT is faster, and is a lot more comfortable to drive and handles so much better..

But there is something to be said about putting the top down in a big block muscle car and cruising the beach."
2479,markcincinnati,March 2015,"I did not mean to suggest or imply that I thought Audi had a 50/50 weight balanced RWD vehicle. I was specifically responding to/about the availability of a BMW or an Audi (my S4 for instance) with a manual transmission. The original discussion/question posed mentioned RWD and manual transmissions. As far as I know there are still a few -- not many any more -- RWD and manual transmission cars that can be sourced from an ever shrinking number of manufacturers. Fewer still are the number of cars that can lay claim to having nearly or exactly 50/50 weight distribution with RWD and manual transmissions.

Again, I must regrettably say it is, as each day passes, just a little bit more irrelevant as we all know, since robots started stealing my luggage.

He seems to say the Acura 8 speed dual clutch transmission with exclusive torque converter is his favorite transmission in the segment. Comparably equipped he says that it's less than the competition by anywhere from c. $1k to c. $12k. He admits it doesn't have the prestige of the other brands, but likely has better reliability and lower insurance costs. Overall, he says Acura has got its ""mojo back.""

I wouldn't mind driving the new ILX, just to see how it compares in handling to the old TSX. It's certainly faster, it seems.

I would come up with a resurrected restyled G. It's a nice idea to have a good naming convention but not IMHO if you tarnish the goodwill and brand recognition of an existing car (G35/37). They could upgrade the current car, restyle as a newer G, and rename to the G39 or something like that. Those original taillights were very distinctive and I could see them replicating something that is similar enough to suggest the old car. And then also address whatever it is about the new car that causes CU and reviewers to not like the new one not so much.

Also, small SUV - they have those but don't seem to sell many. Kind of cute but not an Audi Q5 or even an RDX. They should get something more competitive out there."

""....The big three brands enjoy an enviable combination of advantages -- deep product lineups, global reach, strong residual values and rock-solid brand images -- that aspiring brands cannot match.

Cross-shopping data show that customers of the aspiring brands are more likely to defect to one of the big three or Audi than the other way around.

Not since 1998 has any brand other than BMW, Mercedes and Lexus topped the U.S. luxury market in sales. That year, Lincoln led the field. Before 1998, Cadillac held an unbroken grip on the top spot going back to before 1970.

Since Mercedes grabbed the top prize in 1999, imports have dominated the playing field. Lexus ruled 11 straight years from 2000-10. These days, the top three remain locked in a bitter struggle for the luxury title. BMW has taken the crown three of the last four years but is third so far this year, trailing Mercedes and Lexus.

Ambitious Lexus is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz in a bid to regain the top spot it hasn't held since 2010. Through February, Lexus sales have jumped 26 percent, passing BMW to move into second place behind Mercedes. Like its rivals, Lexus is basing its growth on an aggressive product offensive....

Acura finished sixth in the U.S. behind Cadillac in 2014 but has jumped past Audi and Cadillac into fourth place for the first two months of 2015, demonstrating just how hot the competition is among the aspiring brands....""

5.2 seconds is definitely mid-pack these days. A dead stock 1st. Generation MS3 can do it in 5.4 seconds. Any of the V8 ponycars with at least 400 hp can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds or less.

Agree with your assessment. I've driven a friend's F10 ///M5. The car was insanely fast, yet utterly uninspiring.

Like in my Prelude. Loafing along at 70 in 5th & need to pass? Drop down to 3rd & up shift back up to 4th at 80;)

The Legacy gets the job done. It's far from the fastest car on the road, but it doesn't complain when I floor it at 70 to pass a slow roller and it has to hit 90 to get by:)

That is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance parameter. It's one place my MS3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many cars can match.

Contrast that with my Club Sport; which needs to be kept above 4,000 rpm to make reasonably rapid progress. The Bimmer actually made me a better driver as there's not enough horsepower to cover up mistakes such as over-braking or blowing a corner. Horsepower can cover up a multitude of sins; it's harder for a student to ""get it"" when his first HPDE car has a lot of power and grip.

It does indeed.

But, when a motor with displacement of only 2.0L and offers nearly 300 ft/lb of torque, have to admit, that's impressive. Actually, the torque figures are better than those found in the 3.6L V6 motor they also use.

What, exactly, befell the new 535i? Steering feel. Rather, lack of steering feel.

It's not for everyone- Taruffi uses lots of equations and diagrams to illustrate basic and advanced driving principles. On the lighter side, the vintage pictures of F1 and sports car races at various tracks are entertaining as well.

Now that's funny . It is also sad That (lack of) steering feel is one of reasons I'm not in a big hurry to get a new one. I probably will, eventually, maybe even sooner than later, as my car is going out of warranty in six months and I also like some of the aspects of this new 435i GC, but I'm just not nearly as enthusiastic, as I should be - and the one chief reason is that steering. Every time I get into it and back into my car, I just can't believe how much they messed it up.

BTW, it's not about the car not going, where it needs to - it actually does, quite well. Probably all the electronics help it correct when you turn the wheel too much. But it's like a video game, not a real car. Some may actually like it, cornering with one finger on the wheel, I don't.

Gotcha. I remember your S4 getting hit, fixed, fixed again, & fixed some more. You fought hard (as you should have) to have your car rebuilt back to Ingolstat factory specs as was the right thing to do given that it was 4 months old and still brand new.

Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day. That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you. Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day.

I recently rented a BMW 328, admittedly a low end model, and I was very unimpressed by the steering feel. Frankly (and seriously), our 2007 Mazda 5 microvan has much better steering feel than that BMW did.

Ditto for my Mazdaspeed 3.

2556,andres3,March 2015,"Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day. That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you. Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day. I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track. I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track. I could be wrong (it happens a lot) and truth be told, I've never taken any of my cars to the track. Although I did recently have all the necessary fluids (oil, brake, trans, differential) fluid along with new front pads and rotors changed on my wife's 2011 Pilot. Maybe I should bring it up to LR and see what it can do:)

I don't carry rental insurance given the limitations and lack of use it would receive from me. This was a 3rd party claim, and the 3rd party insurance is obligated (legally arguable, but I think I'd win in court) a ""like"" vehicle. A like Vehicle to the S4 would be an M3, C63 AMG, 335is, ATS-V, cTS-V. Usually those vehicles command $$$$$ to rent.

Given the guy was underinsured, I was warned to mitigate my costs, and so I settled on a ""premium"" rental at $38/day. Given it was Hertz's insurance side, there's like an electric fence between insurance rentals and the exotic sport or whatever they want to call them rentals. Apparently, insurance companies don't believe you should be given a ""like"" vehicle unless ""like"" just means in size. Either that, or they don't believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents

I was willing to pay lots MORE for an upgrade for the 3 days I needed it for the track weekend. I even agreed to pay $75 extra per day (of my own money in addition to the base agreement) over 3 weeks before the event, and still, they couldn't come up with anything worthy. They claimed the C250 was $75/day, but when I needed it, it wasn't available. Hertz is incompetent.

Next time I'll just make another contract with another company and let the $38/day car sit idle for 3 days.

It's not as simple. Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it. The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance. Perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too. It would surely do for an interesting legal precedent.

The BMW 320i has 180 hp, while the 328i has 240 hp. I wondered what differences in the engine could account for that 60hp, but according to this article probably the biggest difference between the two models is in the engine software:

I know it's completely against where the market is going, but to me base BMW 320i with the 6 speed manual and few or no options seems somewhat appealing. It's closest, anyway, to what a BMW 5 series was 30 years ago, except it's a lot safer and has less steering feel.. MSRP in white with Sensatec comes to $33.9k.

I agree, but if you are going to go that route, you might as well go for a 328i with the extra hp/torque so at least your car is fast. You'll also have to special order something like that and wait 12 weeks for it. Or you could do European delivery...

I've never said it's an awful car, but it does lacks a quality that used to be standard issue across the entire BMW model line. And it's a capability that I-and others on the more enthusiastic side of the automotive spectrum-think is an important facet of the driving experience. You don't, and you like your F30. That's understandable, but don't get yourself in a lather when some of us are less than enamored with the platform's driving dynamics- especially when it is fitted with the base suspension..

The fact that I -- to this day -- love manual transmissions and that you ""and others on the more enthusiastic side"" like the ""quality"" that the car under discussion possesses (an older model BMW) makes us, perhaps, nothing more than sentimental, not necessarily correct in our critiques. ""It used to be better when -- fill in the blank -- was the rule of the day,"" is a perspective. It is, apparently, a perspective that is no longer a prudent point of view, however.

The reason is, of course, that BMW and all the other successful brands are doing everything, perhaps anything they can to retain and gain market share. I do believe that today's buyers are actually as enthusiastic, perhaps more so than those of yesteryear. Actually saying that and seeing it in ""print"" is very difficult, but I do believe it is true.

If, on the other hand, the companies that progressively and steadily abandon manual transmissions, steering feel and all the other things we unintentional (and unaware and in denial) Luddites rail on about (when we speak about the good old days from a position on high) somehow all fail, well then we can say ""I told you so.""

Look at the income statements (where and when they are available) of these companies -- if revenue goes up after some period of time after the manual transmission is more or less abandoned, etc, well there is at the very least a strong correlation that those of us who decry the current in favor of the past, are wrong.

As I recognize (and usually don't much care for) about myself: I am often wrong, but never uncertain.

We need to embrace the changes -- I would venture to guess that many, probably most of the changes we complain about are for the better.

Of course, I am certain.

Of course."

Having spoke to my SA about this and the coding the SA informed me that BMW is aware of BMS, and the 3+ lbs of boost, it is within the limits that BMW has built into the car, Dinan now offers something for the N26/20 engine which add's 4+ lbs of boost, so I guess that is within the limits of the engine too.

Precisely.

I've said this in the past more than once, but wanting a lighter and more nimble car that communicates what is going on at the contact patches does not make one a Luddite(as an aside, I design, install, and calibrate 7.1 Home Theater Systems for fun-Dolby Atmos next-and I also repair my own PC or laptop 99% of the time,). If there wasn't a market for those cars the Miata, the Boxster/Cayman, the CTS V/V Sport, the GTI, the 2 Series, and the M3/4- to name just a few-would be dying on the vine. I do think BMW knows exactly what it is doing- forcing the enthusiasts to move up the food chain to get cars that actually feel like a BMW from just five years ago. A few months ago I discussed this same issue with Jamie Kitman of Automobile And Sam Smith of Road and Track, and both agreed that it is more than a bit cynical to make customers pay extra in order to get a BMW that drives like a BMW should.

I suppose the question should be, ""What makes a BMW a BMW? If the roundel and the Hofmeister kink become the only things that distinguish a BMW from other cars, Munich will eventually pay the price.

You are probably right. I drive a little more than 20K per year. Once you start figuring out leases with that kind of mileage, they start to not look so cheap anymore. I'm not completely opposed to leasing either given the right circumstances. I know my wife for instance DOES NOT like driving her Pilot. She does maybe 12K per year. I'm sure once her truck is paid for in a few years and the principle is paid down on my Legacy, she's going to want something. So I could always lease her something nice (like an E-Class, BMW 5er, or Lexus GS) and then buy it out for myself once the Legacy starts to get up there in mileage.

I went into the F10 knowing what it was, and what it wasn't. I certainly wasn't expecting anything like the E39. I loved the styling (particularly with the M-sport package), the pull of the engine (535i) and the comfortable and luxurious ride. In the relatively short time I had it, I appreciated those attributes for my long commute.

But, alas, my yearning for something with more feel to it (not to mention the manual transmission), won out and I bought my Mazda3 a couple weeks ago.

The look on my friends and co-workers' faces when I say I traded in my BMW for the Mazda is priceless. They're used to me trading out cars on a regular basis, but this switch just has them speechless. I kind of have my response down pat at this point - ""I appreciate all kinds of cars, and was missing a sportier feel, manual...etc. etc."" They feel better when I say I already have my next BMW picked out, but need to wait a couple years for it to come down in price.

Having spoke to my SA about this and the coding the SA informed me that BMW is aware of BMS, and the 3+ lbs of boost, it is within the limits that BMW has built into the car, Dinan now offers something for the N26/20 engine which add's 4+ lbs of boost, so I guess that is within the limits of the engine too. When it comes to undetectable codes I can only go by what I have read by many on bimmerfest,
Well, that's cool. I'd get it in writing, though. It is one thing to have a factory-authorized tune installed by the dealer, and another to do it yourself at home, regardless of the programming parameters. Upping the boost is but a portion of the big picture.

He told me there are at least 3 levels of information stored in the car's computer. The first level that you can basically read through the car's OBC, the second that requires the dealer's proprietary equipment, and a 3rd that only regional reps can access. Even with what they could read, the car had been logging all instances of boost going beyond stock limits. He was pretty sure the regional rep could get much more detailed info than that.

After they read the car, he came right back and said ""OK, so you obviously have a tune. Which one?"" D'oh!! But, like I said, he was cool about it.

Back when Erik Wensberg was BMW M Brand Manager he told me a story about a 5 speed E36 M3 that had been flat bedded into a dealership. The owner-whose previous car was an Oldsmobile-said he was simply ""driving down the interstate at 65 mph when the car just died"". Unfortunately for the owner(and his wallet), the DME was interrogated and it revealed a final engine speed in excess of 9000 rpm.

I assume the following are likely / usual suspects, eh?

Acura TLX (and the TL from X number of years backwards); ILX, not yet, TSX was a mistake to include previously, so no.
Audi A4/S4, allroad, and possibly the Q/SQ 5 derivatives and this includes anything under the heading B8 (and soon to be B9 designation); can't figure out if the A3/S3 has any halo effect, yet, that would allow it to be included.
BMW 3's of all flavors and iterations (which would, by definition include M's), and the X3, not sure about the X1
Cadillac ATS -- all variations; CTS excluding the current generation/iteration (or is that wrong?)
Infiniti Q50's all variants; previous gen, too.
Lexus IS (all variants)
Mercedes CLA's and C class (all variants) -- not sure about the CLA's
Volvo ""X"" 60's -- all of them, S60, XC60, etc.

We may have such an active board due to the fact that we continue to have such a wide, er, tolerance of brands.

2588,m6user,March 2015,"Buick Regal GS and Lincoln MKZ?  Buick is more a premium brand as it stands below Cadillac but Lincoln is surely recognized as the luxury division of FoMoCo.  Dodge is certainly not a luxury brand but Chrysler could be considered, like Buick, a premium brand but wouldn't be considered a luxury brand.  Just because a car has a bunch of electronic bells and whistles and stitching on cheap leather doesn't make it a luxury brand.  Many cars are luxurious to a degree but it doesn't make the brand a luxury brand.  Most people don't perceive Hyundai and Kia to be equal to Chevy or Ford let alone be considered a luxury brand.  Granted, they may be equal to Chevy and Ford at this point but the majority perception IMO doesn't put them there.  Perception is reality in the world we live in.

ATS? That's the ELLPS darline right now, so that's definitely in.

2592,markcincinnati,March 2015,"One response: concerning the IS but not the ES. The P in ELLPS (and LPS) stands for? Performance. There is nothing about the ES that could even remotely be called ""performance"" if the assumption includes the ability to (quoting my wife) ""go like a snake in a rat hole."" The ES can't even go like the rat in the metaphor if you axe me.

The possible reason for [my] not including some of the cars in the fold is that they don't offer much ""L"" or ""P"" or not enough to notice. The Buick Regal, was an oversight on my part -- since it can be somewhat low on the P side, but so can an A4 or a 3 series -- I do think the ATS is a better GM example of something that can be included as a full on ELLPS, but I think I will give the Regal at least the designation as a Near-ELLPS.

The action, today, does seem to be in the realm of things that can be called ELLPS or NELLPS -- sure there are better Luxury cars and better Performance cars than those that fit into the universe of ELLPS offerings; but if you have a $45K-$65K car-buying budget, your choices are both deep and wide in the ELLPS designation.

Since LPS cars, these days, seem to have a plus size requirement, I am less and less tempted by the LPS models out there. I do wish my S4 was a bit bigger, but the A6 occupies just way too much real estate these days. I am hopeful the next gen B's from Audi (B9) figure out how to be about 10% bigger overall.

Funny thing about BMWs move upscale; my dealer has a 2011 335i manual SP that I''m considering. I pulled up the Car and Driver test of that car and compared it to their test of an M235i manual. The E90 sedan is three inches longer and weighs only 24 pounds more. The E90 also has a bit better F/R weight distribution- 51/49 as opposed to 52/48 for the F22. Standing start and in-gear acceleration times are virtually identical(and adequately quick). The M235i holds a slight edge in steady state cornering and braking, which I'm virtually certain is due to the E90 wearing Bridgestone Potenza RE050A I RFTs and the F22 being fitted with ""go flat"" Michelin Pilot Super Sports- I can vouch for the Michelins; I run 225/45-18 PSS on my Mazdaspeed 3 as my summer/track tire and I always run out of courage before I run out of grip.
It's interesting how much difference a few years makes with respect to perception...

So the question remains - did the segment move with the car models, or did the segment stayed where it is, and the models ""moved out"" of it. The former means ELLPS is now $45-$60K on the sticker, bigger in size, softer, less raw, more luxury.

2618,roadburner,March 2015,"Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.

My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0 that my girlfriend-now wife of 29 years-found for me back in 1983, so when I bought the '02 by accident(long story) on eBay in 2008 it really was like going home again. The 2002 is lightweight yet feels solid; all the controls are reasonably direct and the 2 liter four does it's best- but with only 100 bhp it can only do so much. Aside from an Alpine AM/FM/CD?Sirius XM head unit all the modifications on my car are period correct-E21 Recaros, Weber 32/36, Delta CD ignition, Bosch Red Coil, Bilstein HDs-so the original character of the car shines through. Even with a direct top gear it easily cruises at 80+. Grip is good but body roll can be unsettling to those used to modern levels of roll stiffness. Still, I could easily see myself using a 1973 tii(with a five speed retrofit, rotary A/C compressor, and a decent head unit/speakers) as a daily driver. No, an E10 is most definitely not for everyone, but for those it speaks to, it is a revelation.

I consider the E36/5 ti to be ""The Last '02"" since it was the final BMW four seat coupe fitted with a semi-trailing arm suspension and a naturally aspirated four cylinder. Unlike the 2002, the ti is much more suitable to use as an entertaining(and economical) daily driver. It has a great HVAC system, adequate power(with a Turner/Conforti chip, at any rate), ABS, and front airbags. The only things I really miss(besides 100 extra bhp) are heated seats and wheel mounted audio controls. It weighs in some 550 pounds less than a 228i- and is 10 inches shorter. When BMW Individual was building my Club Sports they tried to make me take the ""optional"" sunroof but my salesperson stepped up and thus my car was built without a hole in the roof. For me, the car is just about perfect; light, nimble, and a ball to drive. The M42 engine does not suffer lazy driving; if you don't like keeping an engine ""on the boil"" than this definitely isn't your car. And on a winding road what shines through is the car's lack of mass. I've been reading how Mazda's new Miata will weigh close to what a 1994 Miata weighed. It would be nice if BMW started making weight reduction more of a priority. Speaking of vehicle weight, did you know that US safety standards require that the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and interior be designed to protect an unbelted 160 pound male? That's ridiculous, every state has a mandatory seat belt law, so safety systems should be engineered to protect properly restrained occupants. I'd think that would allow a significant reduction in weight and complexity. And anyway, at some point we need to let the Law of Natural Selection take its course.

2619,m6user,March 2015,"I've always considered ELLPS to mean a luxury automaker's entry level car in the performance category, not what is entry level dollarwise for someone's pocketbook. How could anyone possibly define that?"
2620,markcincinnati,March 2015,"$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit. If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more.

I would think we're talking about a particular family of vehicles and that if we really mean LPS (as part of the acronym ELLPS), well you are indeed speaking of the entire family of 3 series from the lowest MSRP version (totally stripped, but, virtually never sold that way) all the way to the fully loaded M3. Where else would you put the M3 if not ELLPS? And, for that matter where would you put the ""typical"" 335 if not ELLPS, it certainly isn't going to fit in with the LPS cars (where the 5 series family inhabits).

$45K - $65K does cover about the widest range for all the cars that are generally considered in the ELLPS family. The thing that seems likely to make the number beginning with the ""$4"" as the bottom line number is the inclusion of the L & P, there are plenty of ""S"" (sedans) out there that can be had for $45K at the upper limit, but they are generally not going to be invited into the ""LP"" club. I would assume that Cadillac actually would begrudge a Regal (a Regal GS) the key to the ELLPS washroom, if the comparison is between the Regal and the ATS. Cadillac probably wants the ATS (all variants) in the ELLPS class and the CTS in the LPS class these days. Buick, based on the test reports of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) Regal GS (starting at $40,195), I would think the Regal ""family"" can probably qualify. Where it becomes a bit dicey is that the bottom of the line model probably would be considered to be quite a bit less full of the ""P"" and the ""S"" of the bottom of the line ATS. And the middle child ATS can easily swim upstream to an MSRP of $55K+ without breaking a sweat.

The point, to repeat, is that the EL apparently seems, more than anything else, to represent the size of the vehicle; but the LP seems to classify the vehicle based on both luxury content and performance abilities. The range, I would think doesn't top out at $45K, frankly it probably starts north of $40K and keeps on going well into the $60's and as long as they are utilizing the same underwear (thinking of the base 3 series BMW at the bottom and the M3 at the top), going all the way into the $70s certainly isn't that much of a stretch.

This is the best range of cars, features and costs there is, methinks.

2621,qbrozen,March 2015,"i really think you gotta have that base price exclude any variants. An m3 does not belong here, IMHO. It is far from ""entry level."" So, for example, you could include both the 320 and 328 because, per my own made up criteria above, they both fall under the $40k base price cap. And by that same reasoning, you can exclude smaller top-spec cars such as the CLA AMG and S3.

2625,markcincinnati,March 2015,"My buddy has a very nice, well equipped BMW 5 series (circa 2003). It is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series.

Where do the ""more expensive"" versions of a model go if not here -- a 335 or an S4 are certainly very very similar, dimension wise to the 3XX and A4 variant from whose loins they sprung, eh?

EL is, today, a size or internal designation (not price); LPS indicates Luxury (which adds cost and sometimes great cost) and Performance (which adds costs and sometimes ooober cost). I cross shopped an A4 Prestige with most options with an S4 Premium+ with three options, because they were ""within reach"" of each other financially. I did not cross shop a maxed out A4 Sline with an RS5 (sorry there is no RS4), but had there been one to choose from, I presume I would still have considered the RS4 as an ELLPS since there is no way someone would confuse it with an A6, S6 or RS6 (or RS7 in the case of this line, since the RS6 isn't imported to the US).

The sales rep I deal with told me he had ""quite a lot"" of S4's coming off lease (that would be the ones prior to the V6 supercharged version, i.e, V8's) and that a number of these customers just couldn't fathom getting an A5 class without a V8, so they went with an RS5 rather than sticking with an S5.

In this class of cars, I think folks look at the size of the vehicle and determine if ""this is the size car I see myself driving"", then they begin with packages, options and accessories until they have the car customized to their liking.

A fully optioned A4 2.0T Prestige with optional features is very close in price to a somewhat less decked out S4, hence my consideration of both. I assume BMW shoppers do the same thing -- they go in for the 328 and trick one out with the option sheet and then test drive a 335 with a few less options and say, ""I'm going to stick with the EL (size) but forego a bit of L for a dose of P in my 3 series Sedan. Happens all the time.

My wife -- set on a Q5 3.0T Premium Plus with about 4 additional options -- test drove an SQ5.

Katie, bar the door -- the 3.0T was super nice -- but the Performance of the SQ was intoxicating.

She did not, however, cross shop with a Q7 or a Q3 -- she wanted the size first, performance second and luxury third. Some folks probably switch second and third -- but there is a cost regardless.

Know too, that some folks (my wife included) checked out the Q5 2.0T first and was ""this close"" to the buy, until she test drove the 3.0T and was ""this close"" until she test drove the SQ, and so it goes.

We choose not to afford a Macaan Turbo (which was close to $90K comparably equipped), but within the family, the choice was Q5 2.0T all the way to the SQ5 with the OMG engine."

I second that. Entry level has a money-related conotation in every single product, job, title, service I know. The only exception I can think of would be in hobby or leisure activity, where it would mean novice, or begginer. In vehicles, M3 or S4 is not entry level in anything. It is compact, or not large, but certainly not entry level.

I used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but I'm thinking differently on that now. I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn't have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it.

2639,markcincinnati,March 2015,"If pricepoint, not size + L+P, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base).

Perhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ELLPS cars because they both start out at a price point of $X.

My car, today, is at the Audi dealer for its 25,000 service interval. Since the dealer has a policy of ""trying"" to match the loaner they provide with the car in for service, I was provided with an S4 for the day. The thing has 1,800 miles on it and is Misano Red Pearl in color (this color is a $500 option); the car also has the B&O sound system upgrade and blind spot monitoring. As a loaner, it also happens to be one equipped with the S-tronic (dual clutch) automatic transmission.

I consider this car below what I would think almost anyone, today, would go for -- but the dealer general manager says no, this car is EXACTLY the base model from a practical perspective, because ""they can't sell"" a version without some level of equipment above ""book"" entry level (what I would call a true stippie).

Indeed, since the car does not have MMI, it will probably only sell because it will -- eventually -- come out of the loaner fleet and be subject to very heavy off MSRP discounting. The ""on the lot"" cars virtually all have MMI+, those that don't were probably ordered specifically without nav with the dealer knowing they would end up in the loaner fleet.

You may or may not chafe at the nearly $3,500 price tag for the MMI+ system, but the take up of that option is, apparently, nearly universal, as is S-Tronic. Yet, sitting on the showroom floor there are a couple of A4's (and one of them, too, is nav-less); I would argue that the base price of these Junior-LPS cars is rarely seen by the actual buyers, since most folks do, typically, go for the ""popular"" option group.

I must note, too, that one reason for the majority going with the popular option groups and/or packages is that the lease calculations FAVOR the high-content variants over the maxed out variants and the strippie variants. Some car-actuary has figured out what will retain the highest residual -- and that, these days, is medium to medium high loaded.

So, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, I would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ELLPS must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a BMW 328 ""Walmart"" (or TJ Max) version and max out at a 335ix ""Bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince."

Eh, I really gotta argue for a max on base price, as you said in the first paragraph above, not range of max pricing, be the deciding factor. Otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a CTS Vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ELLPS cars. Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. The $45k would allow for the 335i and V6 ATS, but it would allow in the S3. The $40k would exclude the S3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. Either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers. I could argue either way, honestly.

The range, then (in base MSRP) is:

$32,950 - $62,000, not that you could with much certainty even find a ""base"" version (without special ordering it).

Just for grins: With most options/packages selected, BUT with zero (no) performance options selected, and keeping the car as a 320i RWD Sedan (not ix as more than half of them are configured) a 320i, optioned thusly has an MSRP of $47,325.

My suspicion is that ""no one"" will option a 320i to $47,325 (and if they do and select ZERO performance options from the order-sheet, that would be even harder to imagine); at that point on the food chain they will, see what could be had with the ""28"" option added and a few of the ""L"" options subtracted; and hey, we're at the dealership anyway, ""ya got any 335's we could test drive?""

Remember -- assuming a Cincinnati BMW dealer speaks for the US dealer body, generally -- most of these cars are leased and when sub-venting comes into play and ""fill-in-the-blank"" luxury and/or performance option or package or both are offered up for another $30 a month, well frugal shoppers turn into fanciful buyers.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but my data point would be to note: ""most"" ELLPS shoppers don't go from whatever they used to drive to an ELLPS to give up such things as Bluetooth phone and audio integration, a backup camera and parking sensors and many other ""we take them for granted"" features they had in their nicely equipped Accords, Camrys, Nissans, and Passats just for the snob appeal (if there is any) of driving an Audi, BMW, Lexus or Mercedes.

Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 (@$52,200) I have today doesn't have a backup camera, park assist or bluetooth iphone audio integration-- who, in the wide, wide world of sports would spend (or expect to spend) that kind of cheese and not get a backup camera, etc?

Based on a quick look, it seems the top versions of those Germans are pricing themselves out of this segment: S4 starts at $48K, S5 is $52K, C400 sedan is $48K, I'm sure the next generation coupe will me more. It's almost like there is forming a separate segment of ""entry level plus luxury sports sedans"", however oxymoronic it sounds, slotting itself in high 40s/low 50s base pricing, with options running up to $70K. One could add R-Design trim of Volvo S60 and ATS 3.6. One could easily make an argument for adding IS350 F and some may want to add top TLX, but I don't know about that. This segment would be distinguished by elevated performance bolted on essentially the same frame of their basic versions. Some additional differentiations by unique colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further.

Then M3/4 and RS4/5 with (future C AMG) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"". ATS-V, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. This segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance. They'll usually have their own colors, increased comfort features, special interior touches, on much higher level of differentiation then models above. They are in fact, their own models. Call them ""poor man's supercars"".

I agree. I think it's again in eye of the beholder. Those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80K-$120K, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances. Something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means. Mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - I don't have it, I do have audible warning system with a colored map picture. I like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local Mercedes Benz dealers stock only those on their CLA, C, GLA class and even some of E-class. If people buy it, so be it.

I know if I were making twice the money I do today, I'd still be buying compact/midsize, but M4/3 or RS would likely make my list. And in that parallel universe, I'd probably think it's still ""entry level"".

The ILX doesn't have the option to power the other wheels nor the upgrade the power plant.

When the new 1 series sedan comes to market next year, then it will replace the 320i as the base model. Soon there will be a subcompact Caddy and that will push the ATS out of the ELLPS.

2667,markcincinnati,March 2015,"Is the common thought that, for example, the A3 is an ELLPS but the A4 is not?

Based on ""history,"" I would keep the A3 and A4 in separate classes of automobiles. And, how is it that both the ATS and CTS can be ELLPS, does that mean the XTS is now the model called LPS?

One point of clarification, my inclusion of cars in this class that can be optioned to numbers deep into the $60K range is NOT the base price. It is the potential price if optioned.

Just like the 320 can have over $15,000 of options added cranking it to just south of $48K, I was suggesting the RANGE from low to high. Most folks won't go for either end, I would assume.

And, each of us brings experience to the buying of cars -- and also to our expectations of features. I cannot see a car without a backup camera, and frankly, I would think top-view is better still. It is a situation where, due to incrementalism, we get a car with, say, back up camera, and then you miss it when it is not there.

Of course, it will be made mandatory by the insurance institute due to the reduction in claims, so you'd better get one sooner rather than later. Who knows: what once were vices will soon become necessities."

IMHO, Audi and MB didn't decide Americans were ready for smaller cars. They decided that they couldn't keep the A4 and C Class that cheap.
So adding to the fun, I'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much.

As far as entry level, I'd agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. You could argue that the ILX doesn't have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the TLX which is the ""ELLPS"" for Acura since it's got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance. And I'd also argue that some vehicle from MB or BMW, etc., might not qualify, in spite of the marquee, if the performance and/or luxury are lacking.

JMHO."

At 12:20 he talks about how Acura's 8-speed dual clutch is in some ways superior to that offered in the Audi A3. The Audi obviously has a lot more prestige, and arguably a nicer interior, but the Acura has more standard equipment—like moonroof, heated power seat, rearview camera, pushbutton start, LED headlights, etc. The A3 does have standard leather, while the base ILX has pleather. The A3 also has a better standard stereo. Overall, a comparably equipped A3 1.8 costs maybe about $4-5k more than an ILX, and yet the A3 is slower and gets lower mpg. I may be the only one, but I think if you're including the A3 1.8 then there's a case to be made for the ILX. But if you're starting with the A3 2.0 quattro, I guess that's a different story....

Well based on my criteria of EL - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the L and P, then the CLA is it for MB.

As for the ILX, many would say the inability to have AWD as option precludes it from being an ELLPS. If it were offered with SH-AWD, then it would be the starting point.

Sort of.

As I understand it, they were engineered together as you said, but the Modeo was delayed being introduced so the Fusion/MKZ were released first.

Why was the Mondeo delayed? Many opinions, but I don't know if anyone other than Ford really knows. The old version of the Mondeo was still selling well in Europe for one thing. Fitting of the 3 cylinder engines and diesel engines all seem to be possibilities. Plus they get the Estate wagon in Europe.

It's not that it's BUILT on a shared platform - as I said, most are. It's how it is perceived compared to other makes. Perhaps it's because Honda Canada commissioned a few generations of particularly awful Acura variations of the Civic that were little more than a different grille and some extra trim.

To some here EL is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32K to $87K.

I have -- historically -- thought of the ELLPS to be mostly a smaller version of the LPS family. Meaning size seems to (in MY mind) still be a better trait than cost. Hell, for the price of my S4, I could have had a Premium+ A6, but the size would clearly differentiate them.

I had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an A3 or CLA or ILX ever being considered for entry into the ELLPS class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] A3 family (which is called an S3) is, well, it is smaller than the already EL entrant, the A4.

Just as we bumped the CTS to the LPS class and replaced the then ELLPS CTS with the ATS, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the ILX and A3.

Today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the ILX and the TLX called ELLPS cars -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the CLA and C Class Mercedes as ELLPS cars.

It seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ELLPS anymore than we would argue an A6 or E class is an ELLPS -- we don't because there are model designations downstream (in both size and price).

We have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the cars are again (maybe) rationalized.

An ILX is an Acura.
An ILX is a tarted up Honda
A TLX has much more L + P than the ILX
There is a car model, not just a badge, below the TLX -- and that is the ILX.

Currently the same breakdown is applicable to the A3 and A4 -- but the new A4 will what? Blur the lines further or sharpen the focus, make the two more readily differentiated? Does anyone think the CTS and ATS are the same class of car -- even though the MSRP of the ATS can be made to significantly overlap the MSRP of the CTS.

And so on.

I'll settle -- internally -- for the TLX to be in the same class as the A4, 3 series and C class. I'll accept the A3 and ILX and CLA as similar classified cars. I just find it difficult to have both the A3 and A4 designated as ELLPS cars if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the A4 and C class, not the A3 and ILX class.

I'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an AWD vehicle knowing what I know and living in the climate I live in. This rules the ILX out -- but keeps the TLX SH-AWD firmly in the fold.

This is getting difficult for me to keep straight.

I love these forums, and I do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when I want to get into one of the forums, I'm not going to venture into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice versa).

I want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- I'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, C class, B8 Audis (A4's), TLX's Q50's, etc, etc. I don't have interest in Malibus (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or LaCrosses or 300's or 911's or Stingrays (same). Yes a fully tarted up S3 may give rise to a legitimate question about S3's vs A4's or S4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the Audi family.

Besides, Audi will soon be rolling out the B9 A4's which will, probably, crank up both the L and the P (and the price) further differentiating the A3 and A4 lines. Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing. Well, I think Mercedes already has with the new C class compared to the new CLA class.

In any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other. Yes, I guess it is possible for someone to shop for an ILX and drive out with a TLX SH-AWD Advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a 335ix -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the A4 to be tested against the 3 series or the C class not the A3 tested against the C class and 3 series, etc.

My head hurts."
2689,stickguy,March 2015,"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level. still within the EL family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors.

ILX/A3/CLA/BMW 1 class (when it arrives) would be compacts. Heck, could maybe slot in a top line Jetta! Oh wait, that is an A3... The ATS goes here too.

the ""mid size"" (probably a bad term) are the A4, 3 series (320/328), Volvo, TLX, Infiniti, MB C class, etc.

To further mess with your head, I don't count the HiPo models as entry level. Call them HP compact/mid-size entry level. that would be the S3/S4, M3, etc.

seems logical to me. And I don't see a problem having a couple of groupings in the entry level category. The all fit the basic criteria: A premium model, with sporting pretenses and reasonable performance to back it up, and a decent level of luxury features. Basically a step up from your basic family sedans or small cars.

and yes, just like with compact to midsize family sedans, there is cross-over in content, performance and price. You can load up an A3 to be fancier and more expensive than an A4, and absolutely people can cross-shop them. same with ILX to TLX,. Still within the ELLPS family.

I put the CTS. E class, 5 series, etc. in the next class up. I think you called them LPS (sans EL) which seems quite reasonable.

Well the EPA is fueleconomy.gov so it is a reliable source. Here is the link:

http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/byEPAclassNF.shtml

The EPA measure cubic footage of the seating areas. Based on that criteria, the Rapide is a subcompact. Aston designed the Rapide with 4 tight seats with a huge console running through the middle of the car. Don't blame the EPA for Aston's poor space utilization.

Many people look at a car, see a big exterior, and expect the interior to be large. Hence, interior volume is what is measured by the EPA."

I'm sure that not consulting the EPA class is true for the vast majority of car shoppers. But it is something that is common across all vehicles that can be measured. The fuel economy listed on the Munroney sticker uses it as a guide.

I think they use whatever ""class"" they can construe to fit their advertising. I recall a discussion about the Ford Taurus which everyone knows is a large family sedan. I believe the EPA had it as a midsize based on interior volume but Ford markets it as a large family sedan. As it should IMO."
2703,tlong,March 2015,"Let's not forget that size impressions change over time. The Accord was a compact that went to a midsized and then a borderline-large car. The current Civic is larger than earlier Accords. And so Honda has introduced the Fit, which is larger than the first Civics. You can use the same analogy for the Corolla and then Yaris, or the A4 and then the A3, or the C-class and now the CLA.

The vehicles we used to think of as ""entry-level"" have gotten larger and new smaller models have been slotted in below them. In a lot of cases those new models are made more cheaply than the original grown models, so that adds a bit of additional complexity. For example my new '98 A4 was a similar size to the current A3 sedan, but I've sat in the A3 and I would say that the old A4 was a much more luxurious vehicle than the current A3, and it also performed better."
2704,m6user,March 2015,It seems like the luxury makers have new entry level cars that are not up to the same level of luxury nor performance of the cars that preceded them. So an argument could be made that they are not ELLPS because they don't have the luxury or performance level expected of the brand.

My head hurts less, now that we can go back to what I presume was actually intended from the get go:

ELLPS - Compact Sized Premium Sedans with Performance capabilities that are not an afterthought or based on trim, badges, decals and chrome

LPS - Mid Sized Premium Sedans with . . . .

Let's keep the Sub-compacts together but differentiate the ""LPS"" Sub-compacts by virtue of pedigree or genuine Luxury and Performance content. If the A3, despite it pedigree, for instance, can't muster anything else than its name to differentiate itself from a Jetta (or whatever), well it would be left out. I think we're all trying to allow, again for example, the ILX to be in a given class but simultaneously exclude the Civic despite the family resemblance.

SCLPS, EL or C LPS and LPS in short.

I would suspect the 3 series and A4 and C class and ATS buyers are more ""birds of a feather"" as would others of the Sub-compact size be birds of a feather. The price range, for example, of the ELLPS is so very wide, but the ""class"" as noted by the original post still seems to my old-fart's brain to be the one that's ""just right.""

2707,markcincinnati,March 2015,"Coming Soon

Picked up the S4 after the 25K service interval where it received an oil and filter change plus a brake fluid flush and refill. New battery for the smart key and a hand wash and front mat vacuum rounded out the ""no charge"" service. I had a new RED S4 as my loaner for the day. Things are going well, the brakes are said to be at 80% of new.

My rep tells me the new S4 will ""certainly"" have a horsepower and torque jump. The reason? The S4 is ALWAYS more powerful than the top of the line A6 (not S6, 3.0T supercharged A6). The new 2016 A6's on the floor have the same 333HP as my 2014 S4. In my mind, however, it just won't do for the S3 to outgun the S4, just like the S6 ""must"" outgun the S4 and so forth.

So, I'm thinking the new S4 will simply adopt the same motor as is in my wife's SQ5 -- 354HP. Apparently that is a no go -- it won't fit under the hood of the S4. So we're looking at what? 10%; would bump the S4 to 366 HP -- and with a bump in torque to 350, or so, wouldn't that be ""sufficient"" to out gun the S3, be bigger than the A6, but still be outgunned by the S6 and S8, etc.

Well, if my sales rep knows some bump is a certainty, don't you think BMW does too? The 335 is due for what a 15% bump? And so forth?

The horsepower (and torque) ""wars"" continue and continue and continue.

How many speeding tickets does it take before your insurance company dumps you or you end up in jail? Making a lighter A4 line and bumping the power by ""only"" 10% is certainly a recipe for ""license and registration please . . . Mark."" God I hate it when the traffic cop knows you by name.

Agreed; that's what I like about my MS3 it's relatively quick(especially since I boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a comfortable cruiser.

Thus: a 320 ""invites"" all ""3"" class cars along with it.

I do not have access to ""unlimited"" funds (as a practical matter, few of us do, even the 2%-ers) -- but my search and the folks I know and ""fraternize"" with (middle and upper-middle class earners) typically buy/lease within a 2 class range. Example: my neighbor says he's looking at BMWs. I say ""what model?"" He says, ""probably a 5 series, the 3 is too small, maybe a 7 series, I'll have to see what kind of deal I can get.""

One day, I see what I presume is a new 535ix with dealer plates in his driveway. As I pass, I roll down my window and stop to ask, ""is that the new ride?"" He says, ""they gave it to me for the weekend, I have to take it back Monday, I dunno."" I say, ""you'll really appreciate the X-drive if we have another winter like this one.""

He says, ""no poop?!?"" (not really).

Next time I drive by -- a few days later, I see a new 7 series in the driveway with temp tags on it. When I see him next, I ask him about it. He tells me, ""the lease payment on this car wasn't much more than the payment on the 5 and this thing is loaded -- I couldn't turn it down.""

Now, for all I know he was set on a 7 series all along -- he is a tall drink of water. But I think he was assuming the 5 series would be fine and fit the financial parms he and his wife had set. Well, when for a ""little more"" he could have a 7 series, well it was probably NOT an agonizing decision.

The thing that cracks me up is what ""always"" happens (and if you don't believe me, spend some time on Audiworld's forums): the new fill-in-the-blank is acquired (purchased, financed or leased) and about 15 minutes later, the proud new owner is browsing Tire Rack, APR, (fill in the blank for your brand of LPS car) etc for ""all the stuff"" that this brand new owner will buy to modify his (or her) new ride.

I have seen -- again, over on Audi World -- folks announce the new A4 they've just ordered, then announce that the car is at the dealer, then post picture of the new car (while it is still at the dealership) with the title of the post ""Let the Mods Begin.""

Folks (broad generalization) buy/lease any of these cars that can genuinely and without qualification be in the ""something"" LPS class and then dump another dump-truck of money on aftermarket tires and wheels, engine management chips, pullies, exhaust systems, brakes, lights, spoilers, coil-overs, audio systems, nav systems, headlights, tail-lights, interior treatments, and . . . (the list goes on and on and on -- thank you SEMA).

It seems to me if you have ""graduated"" to the luxury performance sedans (etc), that you can, practically speaking, pretty much afford anything you damn well please.

The wheels and tires alone ""y'all"" spring for on an otherwise very well equipped 335 or Q50 or S4 cost a young fortune -- yet ""y'all"" go ahead and plunk down the forty-nine, eleventy-twelve thousand dollars on the car and then just for grins put on a $2,400 set of rims with $1,200 worth of rubber on them without batting a freakin' eye.

What really cracks me up is the folks who acquire an A4 and then spend thousands on engine, suspension and tire and wheel mods so that they can create what they designate as an AS4 -- when for another $50 a month they could've had an S4 and be done with it (and the warranty would still be in full force, too).

One A4 buyer purchased one without navigation and then worked and worked until he found all of the parts required to retro-fit the Audi OEM nav system into the thing -- talk about costing a fortune. I often wonder, why not buy an A4 and see how much money and sweat it will take to fit the DSG transmission in place of the 8-speed tiptronic.

It ain't the money that compels ""our"" actions in this class of car -- at least as far as the fan site participants are concerned. Some of the aftermarket audio systems, too, cost more than a new 4K 79"" UHDTV.

AMEX - don't leave home without it.

Point of all this, you guys are right. The only consistent price point you can depend on is the MSRP. We don't pay that. But, it's the only consistent number you can reliably use, that has no bearing on geography, lease vs buy, demand (or not), etc.

Mark, I think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here. You seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker. They said so repeatedly. It may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford. For myself, I don't look at cars at their base. If I can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me. I see no point is a stripper, but I understand why somebody may actually go for it. But that vantage point difference is very real. I generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. S4 used to be IMHO above 335, but that was before they eliminated V6 version of A4 and S4 took its place, giving space to RS4/5. I totally disagree on M or RS. There is absolutely NOTHING entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering. ZERO. Other than superficial likeness, those are different cars than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. Small size? Porsches are even smaller, so what? That's not enough.

I'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: ENTRY LEVEL is price-dependent. Something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. And, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. You can take a $16k Honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. Lipstick on a pig, in other words. Base MSRP provides a consistent basis of comparison.

Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year. 

Here's ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: The list of BRANDs we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer AWD versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. Perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don't always agree. The perception is that the higher performing models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes (just to name the Germans for an example) now offer AWD virtually if not literally and I think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. Porsche, clearly not an LPS generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911's -- I believe they are all offered with AWD. And, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the AWD models.

But, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. Pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck LPS (or, of you ike ELLPS) cars -- the majority of them will be xdrive, CTS or ATS4's, or quattros or four-matics or AWD badged in some way.

Let's assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually REQUIRE AWD for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with FWD or RWD, just fine, were asked if they would give up AWD. I am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don't take away my AWD.""

The perception and the sales have been pointing to AWD, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.

Entry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line cars from a given mfg. And, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, MSRP, that is still true. But I am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given BASE MSRP is the tv commercial and the lease price. And, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $X pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the cars being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. Unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.

The reason is no one will buy one of this class of car NEW at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most Americans won't orders cars, cause they have to have it today -- with cars that are popularly equipped. This translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.

I spoke to a German dealer rep who thought we (Americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our cars since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. Big bucks for a vestigial options. It is virtually impossible to get a German car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won't buy a car that doesn't have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.

The point of all of this is to say, OK, I'll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3's, but NOT A4's (the B9's will certainly cost more than the B8's, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4's, 3 series and C class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America.

If you agree about the use of the term Entry Level as not necessarily being about $, the M3, for instance is the Entry Level M car -- and, at this point in time, there is no Entry Level RS car, unless you accept that Audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an RS4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the US.

We can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the Edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base MSRP.

I'm interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedans -- and, here, luxury performance sedans that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and sisters, the 5's, E's, etc.

Even then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, I would find their thoughts and comments of interest.

If LPS is supposed to include ""I wish I was an LPS car"" type of vehicle, I'm not interested so much.

I think the VW CC or Passat are good cars -- interesting cars, perhaps even desirable cars, but today I don't think they are members of the LPS club. But they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. It's just they aren't LPS class cars. If we're looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.

The reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.

I believe Mercedes is just following the Alfred P Sloan model -- start them out with a Chevy and hopefully they'll eventually buy a Cadillac. Start them out with a CLA and maybe someday they'll be back for an S Class.

It could work.

I think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. The lower cost of the ELLPS vs the LPS is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the EPA classification, if you will."
2724,m6user,March 2015,"""these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.""

That's exactly what an ""entry"" level car is. ELLPS is the lowest price performance sedan of a given maker. If a car qualifies all the alphas then it should be included. I don't personally see the CLA, ILX and 320 for examples as performance sedans even though they are entry level luxury."
2725,graphicguy,March 2015,"All good points. The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens. Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent, Cruise, Fiesta, etc. Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc. Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything. That's how they get to those price points.

Some manufacutrer have become quite clever. They'll wrap their ""cheap"" cars in innovative styles. Look close enough, and it's hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.

When you move up that ladder, into the Civics or Accords, Corollas or Camry, Fusion, Malibu, Mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25K price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.

From my perception, that's where the A3, CLA, 320i, ILX, probably a 2.5L ATS want to play (I suppose you can throw the Infiniti G in there, but that's pretty old these days). Not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, You think, I'm making a little more money, and boy was that C Class ever sexy looking when I was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you're driving off in a $45K C Class, or A4, or 328, loaded up TLX, or an ATS with the better drivetrain, with more options.

All of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. Now, you're in the $50K-$60K bracket. Now, you're looking at E Class, A6, CTS. You wouldn't dream of sullying your driveway with an Impala (even though it's every bit as good as an XTS).

Mark, you're right. That's what Sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.

Where Mercedes and BMW seem to have an advantage, they've positioned themselves as aspirational brands. Cadillac used to be there. I think some of that is still there. Their missteps have cost them some of that, though. I've not driven an A3. But, I have driven an S3. Fun car. To live with it everyday? Probably wouldn't be my choice. Test drove a CLA. That is not a good car. An Accord is better in every way. But, you have a Mercedes, an aspirational brand. And, you're in it for about the price of a loaded Accord.

I'll accept that the 320i is a good car based in FN's reports. But, I've only driven one when my sister was shopping them (she ended up with a C Class.......BECAUSE IT WAS A MERCEDES...320i was the better car, IMHO). Audi wasn't on her radar based on my experience with them.

Audi and Acura are FWD architectures. Today, these platforms are SO GOOD, it really doesn't matter to me. I know for many of you, it does. The Mercedes, Cadillac (ATS/CTS) are RWD platforms. But, Mercedes is bringing their FWD platform here, too.

What does any of this have to do with ELLPS? Probably not diddly....except everyone in here will be in the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes showrooms sometime in the next 24 months....guaranteed.

Started off as and still is the ""cheaper version."" However, that doesn't necessarily mean no options. That's why I've been stressing BASE MSRP. I absolutely concede that some luxury options are almost a necessity to make it feel like a luxury car. The only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the M, AMG, S, or V examples.

So, like I said earlier, the only reason I'm thinking the cutoff is cost, not size, is to allow BMW and Caddy to play here on equal ground. I mean, I suppose its not unrealistic to compare a 328 to an A3, but then folks would be arguing those two don't directly compete. Then we have to say ""ah, but you can't discuss the A4 because its not the entry-level model."" It just makes things more confusing.

I was going to say ""4 rings"". Though in a performance oriented car, the AWD can come in handy (he does live up in a heavy snow area in upstate NY). Something like a GLI where you are getting into low profile performance tires would likely require snow tires, and he has no place to keep those off-season.

As far as people wanting AWD. A lot of people had RWD cars when they were younger and they remember the horrible situations in snow covered streets where they just spun and the rear end kicked out all over the place(I had a 1980 Camaro, loved it but not in the snow) because that was before better all-season tires, ABS, traction control, etc. And after FWD cars took over the availability of RWD mainstream cars is somewhat limited.

So many times I hear someone say: ""my car stinks in the snow or my car drives terribly in the snow."" For the longest time I responded with: ""its probably not your car that drives terribly in the snow, if equipped with a proper set of winter tires you should have no problems.""

OMG, really? Never heard that one before. I see yahoos all the time thinking they can drive faster because of AWD. Sorry, but I'm not one of them. Didn't feel I had to put that qualifier in the argument. OK, same vehicle, same tires, same careful driving then. AWD is easier to get around in heavy snow and slippery conditions given the same type of driving. Does it allow one to drive like a maniac. Absolutely not.

And invariably means that it will always happen sooner or later right? Don't think you can say that about all drivers."

When the wife wanted the Subaru Outback, she wanted something more ""wagon-y"" than the SUV's she'd been driving.

Once she got behind the wheel, that myth was shattered - the Subaru has the same height as our old Mazda CX-7. Same or better ground clearance as well.

2763,m6user,March 2015,"Let me be perfectly clear.  I don't consider AWD  a need but I find it very nice to have many days during the winter and on some rainy days.  It always seems that the people that are so sure it doesn't help get you around more efficiently in the winter are those that live in Florida or Arizona for example.  I have a rwd truck and have had plenty of rear wheel drive cars.  And like I said, equipped the same and driven with common sense the awd will be much easier to get around on slippery, snowpacked roads.  Ground clearance isn't a big deal for me as it is rarely a factor in the Midwest. But slushy or hardpacked snowy roads are very common and awd makes much more secure footing when in traffic and pulling or merging into traffic.

I never said anyone has to have awd but you guys make it sound like anyone that has it doesn't know how to drive.   Comes off a little arrogant IMO."

2770,laurasdada,March 2015,"I grew up in the era of FWD and ""Hot Hatches."" My first car was an original VW Scirocco, followed by an arrest-me-red Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo. Being a lifelong resident of New England, and a skier, I never had any real issues with FWD and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 Acura TL). I told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/MPG drain of AWD when FWD and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time? Even FWD with all-seasons got me where I was going. Of course, ground clearance is another factor...

But, my TL was just not as good in the snow as previous FWD'ers. So, I bought snow tires on dedicated alloys (great deal at Tire Rack) and that problem solved. I had plenty of room to store four tires, and the cost of the tires/2x yearly swap was still less $ than AWD options. Of course, then I want nutsy, cuckoo and traded the TL for the V8/RWD Jaguar XK. With Summer tires. My first RWD, a whole new world of no go in snow. I mean, 1/8"" and I couldn't get out of my driveway! Luckily I had the option of an AWD SUV...

But, man plans and God laughs. Life changes and I suddenly-ish needed a 52 week car. Or a second car. Logic and maturity took over, hence adios glorious V8 sound, hello sensible pair of shoes Jag XF AWD. Could I have gone RWD XF with snows/rims? Of course, with the traction/stability control, snow mode tranny and good snows, I likely wouldn't have had any issues as, generally, a good job is done in snow plowing around here (even with 10' of snow this winter!). But, with nowhere to store a set of tires/rims (without paying to do so), I chose the path of least resistance and went AWD. No worries about the freak storm before/after snows have been swapped or storage and charges to swap tires.

So, I pay for my laziness. Need AWD? No. Glad I have AWD? Yes. XF was a champ in the blizzard I drove through last month on my way to ski Maine. Sad said blizzard was east of the mountains and didn't dump any new snow at the resort!

So, understand and choose your poison. No ""wrong"" answer.

We can (and often do) debate the efficacy of AWD or if a given 911 performs better or is easier or harder to drive if equipped as RWD or AWD, etc etc.

I have to assume that BMW, to pick one, had managers and engineers who were against AWD making its way into the BMW family. Today it is the rare BMW that cannot be had with AWD.

The reason for the proliferation of AWD models is -- wait for it -- because they are popular, they sell well and if you don't offer an LPS or ELLPS with AWD, and all of your competition does, you will lose market share, lose revenue, lose profit, and you will lose your job. It doesn't even matter if it can be proven that AWD is better, the same as or worse than whateverWD. AWD rules the income statement or if it doesn't ""rule"" it certainly is way too large a percentage of sales to be overlooked.

Bring out a new high zoot premium vehicle of the species SEDAN and offer it with only two wheels driven, and, well pretty soon the car magazines will be apologizing to the market on behalf of the company justifying their not class leading sales on the oversight -- no AWD = lower sales.

2790,graphicguy,April 2015,"Continental has a storied name. Did a little research last night on the Continental (which is a moniker that Bentley also uses). At different times, the Continental was indeed a separate Ford brand. Mostly though, it was a model of Lincoln (usually the top Lincoln model).

Again, not sure where Ford is taking Lincoln. Aside from what appears to be a very successful ad campaign for the brand with McConnehey (sp?), I'm not sure how they can sustain the models they have if their only differentiation from the similar Ford models is a little chrome on the grill and some interior differences.

I mentioned in another thread that several months ago, I was offered a %75 gift card to test drive a Lincoln. I drove an MKZ and their small SUV (can't recall the model). They were not bad drives at all. And, were nice in most respects. But, they were also about $10K for the exact same drive in a Fusion or Escape, save for a few extra niceties.

Nonetheless, they're pretty cars. Scoff if you must, but if the Continental comes out and is anywhere near reasonably priced, it will do well. Maybe not our cup of tea. But, Hyundai has proven that when you bring a nice car to market, that may have only 90% of the capabilities of the stalwarts in the category, the cars will sell.

2792,Mr_Shiftright,April 2015,I read somewhere that Ford was thinking of starting prices in the $75K range for the Continental.
2793,flightnurse,April 2015,"robr2 said:


I respectfully disagree. It makes no sense for Ford to create a new ""brand."" The cost would be prohibitive.
Continental is not a new Brand for Ford, look at Fords history and you will see it."
2794,flightnurse,April 2015,"graphicguy said:
Continental has a storied name. Did a little research last night on the Continental (which is a moniker that Bentley also uses). At different times, the Continental was indeed a separate Ford brand. Mostly though, it was a model of Lincoln (usually the top Lincoln model).

Again, not sure where Ford is taking Lincoln. Aside from what appears to be a very successful ad campaign for the brand with McConnehey (sp?), I'm not sure how they can sustain the models they have if their only differentiation from the similar Ford models is a little chrome on the grill and some interior differences.

I mentioned in another thread that several months ago, I was offered a %75 gift card to test drive a Lincoln. I drove an MKZ and their small SUV (can't recall the model). They were not bad drives at all. And, were nice in most respects. But, they were also about $10K for the exact same drive in a Fusion or Escape, save for a few extra niceties.

Nonetheless, they're pretty cars. Scoff if you must, but if the Continental comes out and is anywhere near reasonably priced, it will do well. Maybe not our cup of tea. But, Hyundai has proven that when you bring a nice car to market, that may have only 90% of the capabilities of the stalwarts in the category, the cars will sell.
Having owned a true Continental, they were cars in which people aspired to own, It wasn't until the mid 60's in which Lincoln and Continental shared the same name. Lincoln has started to turn itself around but to offer a car to start in the 70's it shouldn't have a Lincoln name attached to it."

""It's the auto vs stick phenom -- everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior but they linger on lots unsold and unloved. Go figure. ""

So tell me where those lingering stick shifts are. I recently visited a few dealers and even on the models that offer stick, nobody had any.
I did say sarcasm was difficult to convey in these posts -- stick shifts are unloved because the MARKET has determined the automatics, NOT the stick shifts are superior. This, however is not said with sarcasm.

Perception is reality -- sticks are not perceived to be as VALUABLE by those who actually buy cars. The ""supposed throngs"" longing for stick shift cars are statistically insignificant and practically irrelevant.

If there are any stick shifts on dealer lots, they have probably been there for a long time.

When I bought my 2014 S4 the dealer did have ONE manual trans version in stock. My wife and I took it for a test drive -- it was a blast. However, my S-tronic (7 speed dual clutch) auto trans beats it by a country mile.

The MARKET has spoken. In some respects, I guess I'm just the messenger willing to accept the MARKET's decision."
2797,markcincinnati,April 2015,"By the way, for those who poo-poo AWD and say it ia unnecessary of that it contributes to building a false sense of security, why does Porsche offer 20 different 911 models and market most with AWD?

My answer is because the MARKET wants and is willing to pay for it.

But the protests about AWD are about as loud, maybe louder, than those howls about the dearth of manual transmissions that can be had in this market segment.

I would, however, assume that Porsche would not offer so many, nearly all in fact, of the cars they bring to market with AWD if it actually eroded performance.

Ferdinand Piech (hope that is spelled correctly) said he thought all cars would offer AWD someday (and he said that in the '80s) -- those who championed RWD proclaimed ""no way"". BMW lovers said there would never be an AWD BMW; and Mercedes folks said there would never be an FWD Mercedes.

Hmm?"

I am quite aware that Continental was once a distinct brand tate Ford used. It existed for only two years before being folded into Lincoln in 1957.

To bring it back today would be a financial fiasco. It makes more sense to focus on strengthening the Lincoln brand rather than resurrecting a brand that hasn't been used for almost 50 years."

2804,markcincinnati,April 2015,"Someone somewhere once said, ""Life is full of disappointments, get used to it.""

My wife took her 2014 SQ5 to the dealer service dept for the 35K service interval. This dealer typically aligns the car they offer the customer as their loaner car with the customer's actual car. Well, of course they don't have loaner SQ5's (didn't even think they would); so they offer her an S4. She said, ""Since my husband has an S4, could you put me in something that I don't normally have access to?"" Service adviser -- who knows us well -- says, ""Sure, what would you like?"" My wife says, ""How about an A7 or S7."" ""Well the last A7 just left, but we have a 2015 3.0T A6 with sport package that you might find interesting . . . ""

Longer story short: She takes the sported-up A6 and drives it to work, the grocery store and home. Next morning (Saturday) she asks me to return the A6 and pick up the SQ5.

The A6 is, hmm, sublime, it is so smooooth and powerful and almost eerily quiet. The thing accelerates with a great deal of urgency but somehow behind the wheel there is virtually no drama. There's a certain tightness to the suspension (better be, it had the sport suspension and upsized wheels and tires) -- I got the sense this (relatively) large car was proving itself to be damn near nimble.

And, at $59K, it is about the same MSRP as my S4. I could see myself driving this thing -- it has more comfort, but it appears to give up but little in responsiveness to the wheel and whip.

Then I get into a stretch that I know from many years of experience is full of twisties and off-camber turns and those kind of ""liquid potholes"" -- undulations in the pavement that have yet to break through to the substrate. Kind of upside down speed bumps.

In any case, I am seriously looking forward to the ride.

That is, until I take my first corner at speed -- about triple what the posted ""curve ahead"" yellow sign with the big black arrow ""suggests."" The car has NO issue taking the turn, It seems unflapped by my request for it to turn in sharply -- it does not understeer (that I could tell, anyway) and the tires didn't howl.

Damn, damn, damn -- the leather covered driver's seat is a flat as a board and about as slick as a kid's slide. The car takes the turn with great aplomb -- too bad it all but threw me overboard (thankfully I was wearing my lap/shoulder belt and was holding on to the steering wheel with both hands.)

Somewhere I heard, or thought I heard, ""WHOA NELLIE!""

My 2009 A4 Prestige with sport package and my 2005 A6 -- BOTH of THEM -- had sport seats (optional, yes). I returned the car to the dealer and at that exact moment in time, the sales team was sans customers, so I asked (thankful my opinion pertaining to the horrible ""bucket"" seats would not be overheard by any other customers), ""Can I order sport seats on a new A6 with the sport package?"" And, ""Can I order sport seats through the Audi Exclusive channel?""

The S6 (which is another $20,000) can have sport seats, the A6, no matter how optioned cannot.

What a world, what a world. I'm melting, melting."
2805,tlong,April 2015,"I recently visited an Audi dealer after many years away and took a look at the cars. I noticed thath the ""standard"" seat was very flat and uninspiring. The ""sport"" seats were highly bolstered and adjustable.

Back in time, my '98 A4 had its standard seats that were somewhere in between these two current extremes. It's unfortunate that the standard seats in current models look like couch seats and that there is no in-between level of bolstering similar to what you might find in a Honda or Mazda today. I thought the standard seats were pretty ugly."

Even adjusted for inflation and twice the cost, I'd go ahead and pay $1,000-ish for the upgrade -- seems like about $650 would be ""appropriate"" though.

The same is true, apparently, across the line -- the only way to get the really good chairs is to opt for the ""S"" or ""RS"" versions.

I'd go further - the base seats are proof that majority of 3-series and 4-series buyers are there for the badge. I said repeatedly to salesmen that those seats are deal breakers to me. many of them totally agree that those standard seats are true disgrace. I'll admit that F3x standard seats are improved over E9x standard seats, but still way in a different neighborhood of off what a ""sports sedan"" should have as standard. I simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. What's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""Luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option. That is truly pathetic. Now I hear Audi has gone same way? The world is ending, no doubt.

I believe there is an option for all-season non-staggered tires with Sport/M-Sport package. I don't know if dealers order them, but it is possible to order. You can also get a ""normal"" suspension with those, just get x-drive (in this case, Sport/M Sport turns into pure aesthetic package plus seats). To get sport suspension with x-drive, you need to pony up another $1000 for their adaptive M-sport stuff. So there is a way to get good seats without firm suspension.

Buick's reputation for being more reliable than other GM cars may have been severely tarnished by someone actually letting the RPM gauge go past 3K or pushing the throttle past 33%.

I'd of been worried about needing a Hertz tow truck. Of course, I've talked about a previous Camaro requiring a new transmission before the weekend was out. They conveniently towed his car off the track and put it next to the adjacent public highway before the ""Hertz"" tow truck got there; to avoid any possible confrontations about why the car broke down. I read all the fine print in Hertz's contract, and it doesn't specifically exclude HPDE's.

It's not as simple. Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it. The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance. Perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too. It would surely do for an interesting legal precedent.
I'd for certain argue about safety, as if I'm killed in a Kia Rio rental I'd of likely survived in an Audi S4.
I'd leave instructions for my heirs to sue for everything Hertz and the at-fault party were worth (driver and insurance that directly caused the rental in the first place). I'm certainly honestly concerned about safety, as I hope the **** never hits the fan, but you never know.

You could argue you take trips to the mountains, maybe go on dirt or snowy roads, so you have to have AWD. You could argue you need the creature comforts of a premium car, the nice sound system, and other features you enjoy. There's a reason someone buys a luxury sport vehicle, and you can't just replace it with an old Chevy Impala rental because it's as big or bigger and has 4-doors.

As to being insured for HPDE events, as of about a year ago, Geico specifically has made an effort to exclude it in the policy. However, you wouldn't be suing for insurance coverage while your at the track, you'd be suing for ""loss of use,"" as very few cars are track-suitable, or as fun to drive as an S4. I think it's two entirely different concepts. It's equivalent to if your house burns down and you have (loss of use housing coverage) putting you in a 4,000 SF mansion in El Centro, CA, instead of La Jolla, CA. Equivalent to insurance companies, but not anyone else that lives in the real world.

I would rather buy a Mazda 3, fully loaded, for under $30K and have better reliability and a good seat at a reasonable price.

I used to have exactly the same impressions of American vs. German car seats. It looks like the Germans are pandering to the mainstream US tastes and then getting a good seat is another way to nickel and dime those already high prices into higher prices.

People did just fine without back up cameras for decades upon decades; it is far from essential. I got a red S4 without the back up cam and overpriced MMI/navigation, but I do have IPhone Bluetooth integration; perhaps the setup is different without MMI and you didn't know?

Cars are getting more and more expensive, and I believe it is because of all the non-essential ""so-called essentials."" The essentials are getting from A to B reliably. Being a ELPS category means that the L and P are important. My taste prefers my money go more towards P.

You need to get over your ""I got screwed by a Neon"" complex...
It's not just the Neon that was a bad model, take a look at Calibers, PT Cruisers, Darts (problems in Edmunds' own long term tester) Stratus', Cirrus', Pacifica's, and more.

Hence Chrysler still lives in the basement of CR's reliability rankings (including more recent models/renamed old models); the more you think things have changed, the more they really remain the same.

The part that bugs me the most is that it wasn't even his car. It was his parents'. I figure his grandkids will be the ones to give up the grudge.
First of all, it was a shared car; meaning it wasn't just my Parents'. It was shared ownership. Second of all, have things more than name changes really changed? Neon = PT Cruiser = Caliber = Dart. Yes, lots of name changes, but have the head gaskets and AC compressors improved? Yes, they have more than 3 automatic gears now, but has reliability increased? They still sit at the bottom of any credible source on reliability.

Nicer interior, better warranty, dealer experience and luxury brand. For a young guy, pulling up to pick up your date in an Audi versus a Vdub could be a game changer. LOL.
I would add more refined sport suspension, possibly better summer tires (not sure on that one; check to see if they are the same size tire too), more quality control which leads to far better reliability, durability, less warranty hassles, far improved interior, improved materials AND fit & finish/build quality, longer warranty? free loaners if you need a warranty trip, more std. equipment (?), better seats, improved looks (subjective), more color selection, more option choices, and different trim level configurations whereas the GLI is pretty much you get what you get.

A lot of my knowledge on this is from comparing the vast and varied superiorities of the '06 A3 to the same year GTI. Also back then you got free maintenance for 50K miles. I would say the '15 GTI has caught up to my old A3 in most ways.

I'm a classic example of purchasing an entry level luxury car, having a great experience, and moving from $30K for the A3 to nearly $55K (out the door) for the '14 S4. If I was an entry level buyer today, I'm not sure the current A3 would do it for me. I feel the '06 A3 was a better value and car for the time. Essentially, it has been 9 years and the entry level A3 is inferior to my '06 A3 in a lot of ways, plus costing more. The 2.0T A3 Quattro is the right ""entry"" level car, but still, I prefer the '06 interior.

To each his own I guess is the final say. I had the opportunity to drive a RWD vs AWD Porsche back to back and I thought the AWD car pushed a lot in the turns. It's more work. For driving pleasure I would have chosen the RWD. Snow is not an issue where I live, so it's hard to justify the weight and expense of AWD in this zip code. The reason I bought a used 4WD truck was for flooding conditions--i.e., the ground clearance. I guess some AWD like Subaru do lift the car, which is nice--but my friend's Mercedes AWD doesn't seem to have any more ground clearance than normal. He doesn't seem to care or notice the AWD--it just came that way.
I notice the benefits of AWD every time I stomp on it from a traffic light, or stomp on it making a 90 degree turn from a stop which would cause over steer in RWD and excessive wheel spin in FWD. I especially notice the same things when it's raining or the pavement is wet.

At the track I noticed I had developed some bad habits though, as it's possible to under steer and push the S4 around a turn, and still be able to rotate the car with the rear diff at the same time. Essentially you are forcing the car around the turn and pushing the front tires where you want to go even though they are not helping you accelerate. Not the fastest way to drive, and hard on the front tires. You can get away with it though, as the car is very forgiving to a heavy right foot.

My 2009 A4 Prestige with sport package and my 2005 A6 -- BOTH of THEM -- had sport seats (optional, yes). I returned the car to the dealer and at that exact moment in time, the sales team was sans customers, so I asked (thankful my opinion pertaining to the horrible ""bucket"" seats would not be overheard by any other customers), ""Can I order sport seats on a new A6 with the sport package?"" And, ""Can I order sport seats through the Audi Exclusive channel?""

The S6 (which is another $20,000) can have sport seats, the A6, no matter how optioned cannot.

What a world, what a world. I'm melting, melting.

Mark, BMW allows people to add options that are not normally available on US cars, but this has to get the blessing of BMWNA, example, if you order a 328i Luxury Line, you can get the sport seats for $500. Infact many CA are not aware of this, I just found out that Tanszanite Blue Metallic ( an M car color) can be had on any BMW, for $1950, Rick and I both really like the color, I would assume if we got that color on the 328i GT it would be the only one in the US.

I simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. What's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""Luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option. That is truly pathetic. Now I hear Audi has gone same way? The world is ending, no doubt.
I'll take it even further, the Sport seats on the F30 cars are wider and the bolsters aren't as big as on the E90 cars or E46 cars.

2848,markcincinnati,April 2015,"The best seats I have ever had are in my current 2014 Audi S4; my wife's SQ5 seats are about 99% as good as my S4's, too -- before that, I enjoyed excellent seats in:

2009 A4 2.0T w/sport package
2005 A6 with optional sport seats
2005 X3 with optional sports seats
2001 A6 4.2 with optional sport seats
2000 A6 4.2 with optional sport seats
1997 A8 with sport seats and about a million adjustments
1996 S6 with the standard leather sport seats of the day
1986 5000S quattro with the optional sport seats (in wool)

We also had a 1988 325ix BMW with the optional sport package, which, oddly, did not include sport suspension, but everything else was sported up, including the front chairs (which were great) and the super nice steering wheel -- which could not be heated when you got the sport package?!?

Currently, an A6 can be sort of had with sport seats, but, as I noted previously they are called Individual Contour Seats -- they seem to be a cross between the standard A6 seats and my S4 seats, plus massage and ventilation -- but the bolsters are not quite as prominent as in the S4.

I'm with those of you who consider the seats a deal breaker if they aren't what I want.

Most of the above cars that had sport seats that were optional came with a maximum price of $1,000 and a normal price of $500 -- even adjusted for inflation, I can't figure out why not offer the options that people want -- IF YOU ALREADY market them in other geographies.

I wondered for years what the big deal was about NOT offering heated REAR seats -- the cost of the seat warmers is probably quite low and a $250 - $500 up charge seems like a no-brainer. Finally, with respect to Audi at least, heated rear seats are at least offered for an extra charge.

I signed onto the Audi Exclusive web page, and there are many optional choices for interior treatments that can be had -- yet, it is clear it is very difficult to order sportier seats via that exclusive program if they are not normally offered in your market. The Audi Exclusive program seems more like a decorating option than a functional one -- not that that is a bad thing.

While I am ranting, I really don't get why so many things are bundled together into one mid-four-figure ""package"" -- if all I want is a top-view camera, it appears I have to take automatic cruise control, w/stop and start, lane keeping assistance and pre-sense plus. Now, I'd gladly buy top view and pre-sense plus, but paying for lane assist and cruise control with full-stop, start capabilities does not, today at least, interest me.

My belief is that folks do things based on what is marketed to them within certain cost parms.

I am not keen on paying for a seat massage function, when all I am after is bolstered chairs in the first place, so, I am likely to pass on the expensive option, and, without that option, I am likely to pass on the car and HOPE that the next gen A4 line will amp up both the L and the P.

I hope and pray that the explanation for all this bundling isn't to reduce the cost of certifying the cars for sale in the US -- stranger things, I imagine, though."

It would seem that everyone here appears to have an opinion that, to me, reads something like (speaking of the Germans): The way fill-in-the-blank"" (usually filled in with BMW) cars were during the fill-in-the-blank (usually some year or range of years that is at least 5 years ago, often as much as 15) is better than they are today. The author of said opinion/perspective will usually attribute their reasons for stating the ""fact"" of better then than now, to be the current difficulty in getting today's version with a stick shift or the increase in luxury content at the expense of performance, the selection by the manufacturer of run flat tires or whatever other dislike is currently popular.

Far as I can tell, however, the German auto makers Audi, BMW and Mercedes (and probably Porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled THEN and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by Acura, Lexus and Infiniti.

Current auto review magazine's still typically pick a European over an Asian, and more to the point, typically pick a German over a Japanese. When there is a ""comparo"" report between the Japanese ELLPS or LPS and the offering from Germany (in the same class), the German's usually finish ahead of their Japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the Lexus IS bested the BMW 3, and that was over a year ago).

Generally, the German examples rule the category -- far as I can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.

I so wanted to love the Q50 Infiniti (at the time I was in a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD) and did end up ordering a IS 350 with the F-sport package when I thought I would be forced to ""settle"" for a Lexus to replace the Acura, thinking, at the time, an Audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the IS 350. I was mistaken -- an S4 was ""within reach.""

The point or better said, question, is, when were the Germans in humble mode and when were they further humbled by Lexus and Infiniti, to quote laurasdada's previous post?

Maybe, but I although I can't speak to the ILX (though the interior pics did make things looks less than luxurious), I can speak to the TLX with an extremely similar drive train; which I've test driven twice now.

I have to agree with her review for the most part though, and I'm a Honda fan. I think Acura is now overpriced, and/or underwhelming. The car feels slow, but maybe adequate, just not inspiring. The car handles nicely, but again, not inspiring. The interior is fine, but I remember preferring the TSX's interior. I much preferred the TL-SH-AWD models I test drove last year. For closer to $35K than $40K (sticker overpriced, but real deals were to be had), the TL SHAWD made a compelling case. For nearly the same money, the TLX does not IMHO.

I would say the car does everything pretty well, but anytime you give the car a compliment, I feel you have to put a qualifier like ""pretty or fairly"" before the words ""good and well"". No significant glaring weaknesses, but no real strengths either. I probably should have insisted on test driving the 3.5 V6 the second time, but I can't get over that you get an even more flawed transmission than the already flawed but improved at least 8 speed in the TLX.

I think I'd rather buy an Accord Sport model, and save/invest the money saved to buy a future true performance sedan.

2860,markcincinnati,April 2015,"dino - I guess I should add, too, that I don't actually know that the Japanese LPS brands have previously been humbled, either -- but I think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are NOT the winner in comparos in the BIG, IMPORTANT car magazines.

I saw MotorWeek on TV this week and the Lexus GS was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then WHAM! John Davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was NOT at the top of the Premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),

Yet, ""everyone"" I know who has a Lexus loves them -- of course whenever I ask why, the reason, THE reason, THE #1 REASON, the ONLY reason I can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are.

Odd, methinks, how I can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a Lexus, Infiniti or Acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, I take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his Acura is (and speaking as a previous Acura TL SH-AWD Advance owner, I agree -- Acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive B&O option Audi offers for $6,000+).

Don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new Mercedes E or C, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.

My wife thinks that her Infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. But she ended up with an SQ5 (Audi) because ""Infiniti's ain't got no soul."" She was against my getting a 2014 IS 350 for the same reason -- told me, I'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.

I do appreciate, too, that I've read, here, the comments -- positive comments -- about the recent EL and LPS Cadillac offerings.

2861,dino001,April 2015,"To me Lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don't care about cars (don't get excited about them, don't want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don't watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be comfortable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste. BTW, I remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a Lexus. I have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but I understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, Lexus was just perfect for him. Just like Toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money. BTW, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more.

I'm not looking down on those people, not at all - they have their busy lives, they don't need or want to know anything about weight distribution, cornering ability. I'm sure they have other passions that I could not care less about.

However, over time, Lexus noticed that they left that over 20% of those with means to buy their cars wouldn't even give them time of the day - so they change their product (a little) and advertising (a lot - most of their ads are about ""F"" lines even if they actually sell small fraction of those). BMW did the opposite - they have owned those 20% for decades - the 80% majority would stay away, unless the lease payment was right and even after then they would constantly complain about small back seat and ""harsh"" suspension, or road noise, tire wear, or all those things we know sporty cars do (including higher maintenance). So in order to grow, BMW changed their product (unlike Lexus, they changed it a lot). They don't really miss that 20%, because those guys still have nowhere else to go and all they can do is grumble. And judging from sales figures, BMW is now losing much sleep even if a few of them did go somewhere else.

Well acura came out in 1985. Audi was pretty humbled back in those days. I'm still surprised that audi survived the dark era, never mind reinvented itself as a high end brand.

And circa 1990 when the Lexus LS arrived, MB was not doing sport. Big tanks and diesels mostly (exception being the SL, a convertible tank!).

To me, BMW is the only one that really evolved from the original ELLPS days, since the other euros weren't in it back then. To a large extent the 1st legend and Infiniti were it along with the 3 series.
Whatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).

So, yes, Audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but NOT by Acura, Audi was humbled by Audi. Their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done 'em in.

The Lexus LS may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public's eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a Mercedes S, well, sorta] car -- today a top o' the line Lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons I noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the Hyundai Equus is cheaper than an LS is today, too, though). Then, I don't recall that Lexus actually took too much out of Mercedes pockets. The only country Lexus was sold in was the US (OK, North America). Even today, a company like Audi sells 175,000 cars in the US (out of total sales of over 1.2M). So while we're important for the image (which is huge), we're not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn't even spell globalization.

I would think the Germans and the Japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble.

I assume they're all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of Korea -- and even the American manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.

So, my retort is pretty much that Audi, not Acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 Minutes story Unintended Acceleration) for that brand -- and far as I can tell Audi's behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.

Mercedes, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by Lexus wasn't really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the US (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet's uptake of Mercs.

And, while I pretty much agree about BMW's -- a 1980's era BMW was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.

The folks I knew who knew or thought they knew about cars (remember I'm old enough to have been alive then) in the early '80's often would equate BMW's and Porsche's -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that BMW stood for British Motor Works.

I'm still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it's the Germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""

Check out the new Car and Driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" S5 kicks butt and takes names AGAIN! -- wonder how the Lexus fares? Hmmm?)

This needs to be updated (to include a Japanese stereotype and to relate it to cars):

""Heaven is where the cooks are French, the police are British, the mechanics are German, the lovers are Italian and everything is organized by the Swiss.

Hell is where the cooks are British, the police are German, the mechanics are French, the lovers are Swiss, and everything is organized by the Italians.""

I think you've hit the nail on the head. If I would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15K less on a TL-SH-AWD from my S4, I would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary Acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership.

Ultimately I decided on the S4 because it looked better inside and out (style), drove faster, quicker, class leading transmission system, handled better/sharper/faster, the brakes felt better, the Quattro seemed superior to SH-AWD (less of a FWD with AWD on-demand type thing like Acura), and I could get it with contrasting Napa Leather interior (chose the Magma Red; beautiful). Also, I could choose Misano Red exterior whereas with Acura you have to settle with a purple looking red.

Lastly, I know the S4 is very easily tune-able, as I'm now driving an S4 that is as fast as an RS4 at 395-to 405 HP with just a simple REVO flash software tune. Your power varies based on the quality of gas and conditions like temperature. Get 93 or 100 octane gas and you can easily get to 410-415 HP. I do feel the difference. It is as if the car is doing what it was always meant to do now, performing the way the engine can perform without restrictions, limiters, & regulations being in its way! Without making concessions to the EPA, emissions, nannies, fuel economy, and insurance company charge rates (I think this is why Audi under rates the power in its cars), the S4 is a BEAST. I think 400 HP is a new magical number. Of course, 300 HP would suffice if the car was 500+ lbs. less.

Granted, if you don't have a heavy right foot, you can still keep the EPA happy with your gas mileage. I see no negative effects in daily driving. Just positive effects when you get into it!

I'm going to stop typing and try to find a revenue patrol-free road zone right now! Have a great weekend everyone!.

2866,laurasdada,April 2015,"Mark, et. al. When I used the words, ""further humbled,"" my thinking was along the lines of the effect of the Japanese mfgs. moving upmarket and the perceived value propositions of the German marques to the general public. I believe, and certainly more so due to the original Lexus LS after Honda fired the first shot, that the Germans were a bit surprised by the reviews and acceptance of the fancy Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans.

I'm a fan of the Euros, my first car memory is of Dad's Borgward and my Mom's Mercedes. My first car was a VW Scirocco. My last two cars have been Jags, likely fueled by memories of my Dad's friend's Jag E-Type convertible (and the fact that they are beautiful, fun and reliable cars!). But, I grew up during the era of fuel economy, hot hatches and the rapid ascent of Japanese cars. My father lusted after the BMW Bavaria, but friends that had them couldn't vouch for their reliability and he grew tired of the expensive repairs to the Mercedes and so they went Japanese (including a Datsun 260Z!). So, I believe that that competitive environment improved the breed. Well, except for GM, of course!

2867,tlong,April 2015,"Currently renting a brand spanking new Jetta from Avis. A fairly stripper model, not even a sunroof.

The exterior is that loud red with a hint of orange that VW has had for years. It looks sharp in color but the styling is still very bland. The trunk is nicely carpeted and huge.

The interior is a sea of hard black plastic with touches of fake chrome. The only soft surfaces in the interior are the seats, the carpet, and the steering wheel. All else is hard as a rock - dash, side panels, center console. When started the engine made a horrendous sound in early idle but seemed much smoother at higher speeds. The steering is tight with good feedback. The freeway ride is ok but nothing outstanding. Compared to previous generation Jettas it is bigger and more chintzy.

But even though cloth, the seats are decently bolstered, not couchlike as in the standard seats on new Audis, or (apparently) BMWs. Go figure."

2869,markcincinnati,April 2015,"The thing that ticks me off with the Audis at this point is that the best seats in the house are, for mere mortals (financially) in the S4 with the upgrade option, mine in red! To next experience such chairs, you skip over the A6 and go straight to the S6 -- which, let's get real, usually is tickling the underbelly of $80,000.

The S6, by some crazy metrics, is actually a bargain compared to the other guys, but jeeeeze, what if I simply wanted a very nice A6 with the new supercharged V6 engine and SLINE, not ""S""?

Fughettaaboutdit.

In my case, I love the SIZE of the A4/S4 and am anticipating a nicer package job in the B9 S4 -- so assuming the seats are still offered in that model, I need not coax the missus into the ""logic"" of an S6.

BTW, there is NO logic in an S6, it is pure emotion at that point -- the thing is wicked quick, super fast and beyond sublime. I haven't driven a latter day S8 yet, but I just can't imagine ever needing one of those.

The S6 is irrational -- which is why we all want one (if we have driven one). But a new gen S4 may be a better performer, more fun and quicker through the twisties (and I am NOT speaking about ever tracking any of these). The fact that a new S4 ""nicely equipped"" can be had for under $60K is just a bonus.

My wife and I are ""60"" years old -- we have a Sheltie and we each have a job. We have no kids at home (other than the dog) and life is pretty much low stress, so we have time to indulge one of our hobbies, test driving cars. Having said that, I urge you to go to an Audi dealer and just sit in an S4 (or an S6) and enjoy the seats. I don't mean to persuade you to the Audi brand as much as I am trying to get us all on a level conversation field -- and that is this: good seats are the enemy of great seats. You may think your ""fill-in-th-blank"" prospective ELLPS or LPS car has good seats -- and it may be thus. You may actually find better seats than Audi deems fit to put in its S cars -- and if you do, for god's sake please share. And, I'm already pretty much a fan of Volvo seats and Porsche seats, so those don't need to be discussed.

My point is, if you don't have to find a sitter or arrange your schedules to spend your weekends driving cars, take a detour to the showroom noted and try the S4's seats out.

Were I able to check a box and make these seats available across the ELLPS and LPS universe, I would. Who knows, were seats this good available from several manufacturers, perhaps I could see myself driving another brand.

Of course, if you want, you could even test drive the car to see how great seats make driving all that much more fun.

Remember good seats are the enemy of great seats."

I saw MotorWeek on TV this week and the Lexus GS was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then WHAM! John Davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was NOT at the top of the Premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),

Yet, ""everyone"" I know who has a Lexus loves them -- of course whenever I ask why, the reason, THE reason, THE #1 REASON, the ONLY reason I can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are.

Odd, methinks, how I can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a Lexus, Infiniti or Acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, I take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his Acura is (and speaking as a previous Acura TL SH-AWD Advance owner, I agree -- Acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive B&O option Audi offers for $6,000+).

Don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new Mercedes E or C, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.

My wife thinks that her Infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. But she ended up with an SQ5 (Audi) because ""Infiniti's ain't got no soul."" She was against my getting a 2014 IS 350 for the same reason -- told me, I'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.

Mark...if I wasn't known for flipping cars every 2-3 years, I don't know that the CTS would have made it to my garage.

That said, the last GM product I owned was a Chevy Tahoe, which was well put together, uber reliable, and aside from fuel efficiency (which was at best, dismal) cheap to own and operate. But now, Tahoes are a $65-$75K step down from $80K Escalades, So, not sure I can say they're in any way shape or form, economical.

So, if I keep my CTS long enough, perhaps I can really see if GM and Cadillac have changed.

All that said, I mentioned a few months ago that I had tested an S3. Suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous S4). Ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the Audi dealership on the east side of town. He recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get Audi to fix my car). It took me awhile to place him, but I knew him.

Kind of funny because I think at the time he was the Audi sales manager. He said he's doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group. He was the ONLY one who at least tried to get Audi to swap me out of the troublesome S4, which they refused, preferringto irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back. Go figure.

Anyway, he said he was starting at the dealer group's Porsche store next week. He wasnted to know what I was driving (didn't denegrate his Caddy competition saying he thought the CTS was a good looking car). Last day at Audi is today. Starts at Porsche on Monday.

I told him of my test drive of the S3 and that I found it way too stiff. He said he hears that a lot and blamed to high perforamnce summer tires. He said the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.

He did have pics on his phone of a new S3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior. He said they just put all weather shoes on it and I should stop by for a test drive. He said he wanted to leave the Audi store on a bang.

Told him I was still stinging from my last go round with Audi. He didn't minimize my feelings stating he totally understood. But, he also said that was highly unusual.

Not in the market, but pretty day...might go for a drive.

2871,graphicguy,April 2015,"So, i actually gave the S3 another test drive. I usually don't go to any dealerships on a Saturday given they're busy and I'm not in the market. But, with the invite, I did.

Dealership had a couple of people in it, but not busy by any stretch.

Sales Manager I spoke to was there. He came over, shook my hand. Told me he was working a deal but got the keys for the S3 and told me to take it for a spin. He asked if I wanted his used car manager to look at my CTS....NO!!!!!!!!!

Onward...pretty car in the metallic white Still a bit cramped but felt a bit aierier than the IS350 I tests drove awhile ago. Ride is much better with the all seasons. Probably give up a little at the edges of handling, but the all season certainly would make the car more liveable on a day-to-day basis.

Seats are good, but not as good as the TL's or the CTS's. Not off by much, though. They were actually better looking than the ones I had in my previous S4. But, my S4 seats didn't have soft leather inserts, either.

Faster than my CTS by a good meadure, although the motor is still a 2.0 Turbo with more HP but less torque. Weight (less on the S3), gearing and the DSG trans are what I attribute that, too. But, the CTS is roomier. In truth, it felt about as fast as my S4.

Nice interior, as expected. Much less in the way of controls, especially on the console vs my S4. Not sure one is better than the other, just different. This one had the handwriting recognition. In my brief time with it, it was hit and miss. LCD Pollping up out of the dash is way cooler than the tacked on screen with Benz or BMW. I'm used to my CTS's interface and have mastered it. I have familiarity with the Audi MMI. Not much has changed from what I remember.

Handled well, rear danced a tad over some bumps, but it wasn't too bad. Never felt that in my S4, TL nor my CTS. LIke the CTS, lots of torque low. I like that. Not much is going to blow by you in the S3.

Steering was direct. I liked the steering wheel a lot, but I liked the one in the S4 a lot, too.

B&O stereo still trails the ELS in the TL and the (believe it or not) uplevel Bose in the CTS.

Stickered for nearly $49K. After a nice 30 minute run, I went back to the dealership, with only one customer taking delivery of an A6. SM asked how I liked it. I told him that for the money, I'd choose it over a 335i or C300. First, that kind of sticker will barely touch either of those cars. And, the S3 will outperform both.

He said he'd entice me by offering 5% off MSRP. Not in the market, and he knew I had an aversion to Audi.

But, if I still liked Audi, and I was in the market, that would be a helluva car for the money.

2872,nyccarguy,April 2015,"@graphicguy - nice write up. I sat in an S3 at the ny auto show last week and definitely liked it a lot. Just those seats & steering wheel (same with the VW Golf R) alone was enough for me to stroke my chin and start thinking... I also like the fact that one can go light on the options & have a car that stickers in the low - mid $40K range. I also like that the screen pops in and out. I can't stand the ""iPad glued to the dashboard look."" I'd also hate to think what that would cost to replace once the car is out of warranty;)

Kudos to your dealership for recognizing the problem with the car's ride & switching out the tires. What are the OEM tires anyway?

2873,markcincinnati,April 2015,"Personal preference to be sure: the current Audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started. The screen contains information I would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up.

Years ago, Pioneer offered an after-market head unit that had a similar pop-up screen. My 2005, 2009 and 2014 Audis all have the screens integrated into a sweeping clean looking dash -- no clutter, no pop up screen that looks like something from a SEMA show.

In short, those pop-up screens look, to me, to be aftermarket, not well integrated and, indeed, somewhat fragile.

They are ALMOST a deal breaker. The prev gen Cadillac CTS (2012 for instance) had a much better pop-up in terms of integration.

My prediction, the pop up screens are going to go away (at least in Audis) within a year or two. Probably just the time I'll be back in the market, hoping that there is a new B9 S4.

Dealer noted to me yesterday: ""The A6 now has the S4 engine; and the S3 has equal to or better than acceleration numbers than the S4. . ."" ""Audi will not let this stand, if history is any guide -- the new S4 will bump both HP and Torque to improve performance over the S3 and to show better numbers vs the A6.""

Stay tuned.

The S3 has a ride that, to me, takes firm into the realm of harsh.

Of course one man's harsh is another man's firm -- perhaps that's what Audi Drive Select can address."

That's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. Many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. It's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. As I recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded.

BTW, I recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after BMW and ATS came out. It was the 328 vs 2.0T. Reading it was almost Alice in Wonderland experience - they gave ATS higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. Yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. My thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ATS on some creature comfort items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). In other words, ATS was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which I find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test.

BTW, I recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after BMW and ATS came out. It was the 328 vs 2.0T. Reading it was almost Alice in Wonderland experience - they gave ATS higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. Yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. My thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ATS on some creature comfort items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). In other words, ATS was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which I find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test.

2882,rayainsw,April 2015,"I like the V8 Charger a lot, thanks. No issues at almost 4,000 miles.

There is certainly much to like about the S3, for me.
However, the price is quite high when well equipped,
to me \ from my point of view.

For example:
Although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds I associate with the price point. Ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but I prefer more immediate torque delivery from low RPM. It does pull well, once RPM & boost climb. The DCT & final drive gearing requires much, MUCH higher RPM in top gear at cruising speeds than I prefer.

The interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.

The sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. Here in HotLanta, that is really not a good idea. . .

Although handling inspired confidence, I agree regarding the ride quality. Part of that may also be the S3’s relatively short wheelbase.

The interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were comfortable and supportive. With full leather seating, I do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the Charger – and it works really well!

I liked the fact that the S3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. I do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.

Clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences.
That’s all I recall – last drove one in December.

That's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. Many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. It's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. As I recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded.

I read the same thing this weekend. Quite surprising, even for me - and I'm not a GM fan by any stretch of imagination. Another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. You have to do it again and again - and again. I guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up.

I wonder what kind of deals are out there. Or perhaps, GM reduced the incentives in some major way and buyers, used to them, refused to buy at near the list price. This happens sometimes. Midspring inventory glut is a bad sign - too far away for the ""all new"" model with a new rear spoiler and wheel package, all that metal eating the dealers' financing. Also, GM used to be notorious for overproducing and the doing fire sales. Old habits die hard? I really wonder why is it so bad for a product that ain't that bad at all. Perhaps it all comes down to price.

GM and Cadillac have chicken and egg problem, for sure. They want to be considered equal to the Germans, so they list price their cars accordingly. But because that's not the reality for now (at least in minds of the public), they have to concede on incentives - which perpetuates the situation. They could reduce the production, but the have to sell certain minimum volume to stay in business. It's a tough business, for sure. I think they need to overhaul their thinking in terms of not just product, but sales expectations, production, relationships with dealers, etc and model it more like those German guys. For example, BMW has quotas and allotments, but it's dealers, not the region, who decides on actual configurations within those allotments. There are (or at least used to be, when I got mine) reserved features (like some colors), which require a real customer order (in other words, those are special order only). I heard it's common for purchasing managers to fake customers to get those on their lot. I wonder if Cadillac dealers have similar system, or do they have to take whatever Detroit guys send them (I heard that was the case for lower-tier brands).

I'm with you - it's really too easy to throw such an accusation, especially on a board like this. I wonder, if Joe Smith, a poster would say such a thing so quickly and loosely, under their name on camera on national television, so GM and C/D lawyers know where to send a complaint.

So, before I comment, I need to know why you feel the sport pack makes a difference in such a comparison. I mean, the adjustable magnetic ride control on my CTS is generally regarded as superior in any comparison, so you can't be talking about suspension.

My 135 was definitely fast, especially after I added the tune, downpipes, and intake. But the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the Caddy's feels. For example, if I was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the CTS. Of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that.

Displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. In my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most challengers.

I've been looking around for a manual CTS-V and they are certainly thin on the ground- good ones are, at any rate. I also wouldn't mind a G8 GXP with a stick, but most of those were bought and stored away by collectors

Can't really make that connection. I think the build and materials might actually be a little better in the CTS vs the 5. You don't see it that way. No problem for me. That's why they make all sorts of different cars, models at all kinds of price points. Plenty of choice for everyone.

I do like the 2.0 turbo motors that Cadillac, Audi and BMW use. I like the one in the Caddy a bit better than the other ones, though. INHU, it pulls stronger than the other two. My opinion is the CTS handles better, too. Cadillac really dialed in the suspension on the CTS.

Haven't driven the diesel in the E Class. So, I can't comment on it.

Now, if you ask me about the straight six twin scroll turbo with the performance package I had in my E92, then I'd be hard pressed to pick any of the other turbo 4s over that motor. But, you put that in a 5 Series and you're closing in on $70K.

I'd probably opt for a CTS-V (or even a less expensive CTS-VSport) for that kind of cash.

Hmmm...
RB....I drove both the 3.6 and the 2.0T in the CTS. 3.6L is a nice motor. I preferred the 2.0T. It pulled better in the very lower reaches of the RPM band. If it had been a 3.6L TT, then different story.

But, as the review points out, it seems BMW is swapping places with the old Cadillac....getting softer, while the CTS is becoming more of an athlete in the group.

In truth, I think performance numbers for the 3.6L and the 2.0L for the CTS are just about equal. Some rags have the 3.6L a few ticks faster, some have the 2.0L a few ticks faster. Pick the one you like best, which is what I did.

It's true, but they were ones who shouted from rooftops how great their product was, worth paying the money. So the crowd came, but BMW decided the services of shouting are no longer required. They may be right, for now. It's more important if in say ten-twenty years, when nobody shouts and people buy because they got a good deal, BMW goes Acura's way. It's easy to imagine that. Acura was also on the rise, until it was not. They basically have two models of consequence - MDX and TLX, and the latter one is still not close in popularity to old TL. I don't know, we will see.

VW found the plot again(as the Brits put it) with the Mk V and have not deviated off course with the Mk VI or Mk VII.

I know it is an overused concept, but when a successful automaker deviates from their core DNA, bad things will probably happen.

Caddy is moving more towards the good handling/performing, well built sports sedans in addition to handing with the perennial ""cash cow) Escalade.

Acura, while I've always liked them, admittedly seemed to have been hit particularly hard by the crisis in Japan over the Tsunami and the subsequent nuclear reactor fall out. I think they're just now really recovering from that, Not sure why it's taken them so long to regroup vs their car manufacturing counter parts, but it has.

I've read that Honda is ready to jump back into the fray with Si type products. And, you can see some of that trickling into the Acura space with the NSX, upgraded ILX, and what I'm betting will be a TLX-S not too far out. They're already the ""wagon"" of choice umping the more upscale SUV shoppers.

Funny about BMW. I like them as well as any other brand I've owned. However, they do have a tendency to play the ""ready-fire-aim"" game. Take for instance the iDrive. When it first came out, it was terrible. BMW said we didn't understand it. That was part of the problem. They built an interface that no one understood. Now, we see them moving away from their ""core"" values as a car maker. They're getting further and further removed from the attributes that built them as a company.

I live in Cincinnati -- Cincinnati surrounds a city called Norwood. Norwood WAS the city that made Firebirds and Camaros. WAS the city. The folks that built the cars did such insane things as put pop bottles in the doors, assuring the cars would be delivered with rattles. Time and time again GM would give in to the workers demands for ""whatever"""" -- predictably and obviously, but not so to the folks who actually built the cars, GM said, to hell with it, and announced the closing of the plant. Millions of dollars of salary and taxes would come to an end. The response? The workers ""threatened"" productivity.

I bought and/or leased ONLY stick shift cars through 2003. I couldn't even take my car to a full service car wash, no one knew how to drive it -- once the noise and smell of my gears grinding and clutch melting was so terrifying, I decided, ""I'm done -- the basterds (spelled that way on purpose) have won.""

YOU are the reason the cars are as they are -- I bought nearly 30 manual transmission cars (from Germany, no less) the rest of you folks were buying auto transmissions. Now, after the plant's closing you threaten productivity? Too little too late.

Now, you're being told, I gather, that if you want what ever it is that you want, you can find it in an ""M"" BMW -- well, folks, if you don't buy them, you can be 100% certain whatever it is that you think you want will be discontinued due to a lack of paying customers.

The cars are as they are due to the market's acceptance (measured in BUYERS) of whatever it is they sell.

If they sell purple, green, red and blue and no one buys a blue one -- figure out what will happen to the availability of future blue ones.

You'd think this was some sort of plot against you -- foisted upon you by evil car manufacturers who only want to produce more and more car models and configurations that no one whats?!? Pull the other one.

I don't know what is being taught today at US universities that passes for economics, but it must not include the simple explanation of demand and supply.

Have you seen some of the car ads on TV? Some of them portray the company's cars being driven by handsome men and pretty women zooming off in the ""fill in the blank"" equipped with a stick shift. Clearly some cars with virtually nil up take on the cars marketed, still market the notion that folks lust for stick shifts (for example) -- where the rubber meets the road (where the cash changes hands) the transmissions are rarely manual.

Let's talk about the upcoming reality, more and more driver aids -- less and less driver involvement -- that is where everything is heading. The reason things are heading where ever it is they are heading is MONEY.

If you think we should have BMWs like they used to be decades ago, fine -- pony up the money.

I must admit, I wasn't all that keen on driving a dealer's car, especially since I know and they know and I know they know I know, that neither of us are currently in the market; but my sales rep, Greg, had a 2015 S5 with the Sport Differential option (and 60 miles on the OD) just sitting there, and, well, he knows my wife doesn't have any experience behind the wheel of an Audi S car with torque vectoring (TV). The rest as they say was inevitable.

We went out for a long drive on familiar twisty (and in great condition) secondary roads. I went first at my wife's insistence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) AWD car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.

As I am familiar with the road where a sign indicating 15 MPH (right turn corner) is the correct speed, according to the Ohio DOT, to navigate the turn, I know my non-TV equipped S4 can take said curve @ 45 MPH. Therefore I assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (I do not have these) and the TV option, the TV equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 MPH without drama.

I was proven correct in that I easily took this ""curve"" at 54 MPH with help from what feels like it could be ""The Hand of God."" Entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, NOT accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when I reached the apex of the corner, I dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.

The rear end of the car was seemingly grabbed by a giant foam rubber hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually drama free. Speed? Yes? A bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? Oh hell yes!

Next up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer's decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. Once again, almost counter-intuitively I entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where I cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""

Again, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.

A couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""

Up next, my wife -- our idea was this: I drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). My left curves were her rights, and so on.

Once she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling TV the hand of god.

I guess, other than sharing this with y'all, I would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" Someone once said, ""nothing else even comes close.""

I am ""OK"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, I will never get another car (on purpose) without it. The Acura's SH-AWD is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: It is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.

So while I admire and recommend only getting an Acura equipped with SH-AWD, if you're looking at the brand, I can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of TV in the S5 I drove this weekend.

Too bad I'm not in the market -- for an S4 thusly equipped would be sick.

2962,markcincinnati,April 2015,"Next up, two more test drives, one in a $56,000 A5 2.0T quattro Cabriolet and one in a $67,000 S5 Cabriolet.

Question to self: Would you REALLY drive with the top down even 36 days per year (about 10%), or would the real number be even lower. Maybe a Cabriolet makes sense in LA,

Both cars were super smooth, top up or down. The S5 was the champ due to the engine and transmission -- and, if you feel the need for losing your top, either one of these cars certainly scratch the convertible itch. . .but, no thank you.

Of course the service manager is telling me how important it is to have the window replaces at the BMW because as he put it, he has seen some horrible jobs which cost the owner thousands of dollars to repair.. We have gieco for insurance company, and have zero deductible, but they will only pay $40 an hour for labor..

It was interesting to hear this guy talk, he and another guy only do high end cars and they are the ones who go the dealership and do them.. So the dealer was going to make $500 bucks by having someone else do the work...

Old School -- not even sure, anymore, what that means exactly.

My all time favorite car -- until now -- was a 1995 Audi S6, fully loaded, manual transmission version. I loved that car. As my newer cars came along, I appreciated their improved technology, safety, performance and luxury, but that certain something the 1995 S6 had was always something I looked and hoped for.

Finally, my '14 S4 has both that ""certain something"" (old school) coupled with the tech and features available on a modern car (new school).

I bet if someone brought me a pristine 1995 S6 to drive, I'd find it, today, underwhelming.

Of course, that was then, this is now . . . I've let go of the past, even though I still remember it with great affection.

I really doubt there would be much of a market for old school vehicles anyway. . . .

My current 13 Accord is faster than many V-8s I've owned, gets 30mpg plus and doesn't require frequent maintenance and has been trouble free at 38000mi. It is safer, full of modern tech features, a pleasure to own. A far cry from roll up windows and an AM radio!

I chipped an Audi TT (MTM chip) and sometimes under full throttle, the engine would just shut off, requiring the car to be restarted. It did this intermittently, and it wasn't until we decided to trade the car in on a more powerful TT that MTM came out with the ""software patch"" that cured this issue.

Chipping, initially, is an inexpensive way to get gobs of power (mostly torque) from blown engines -- but unless the chip's effects are 100% reliable and predictable, well, I am of the opinion that I will just get a bigger meaner more powerful version of the car in question, rather than trying to patch the OEM's software for engine management. Limp home mode is scary -- worse than that it can be unsafe.

Dinan and BMW work closely together, and if you have any Dinan work at an authorized Dinan shop, it is covered under the factory BMW warranty. My 330 had many Dinan upgrades to it and never had a problem. My piggy back on my 320 has been flawless, not one problem, no code issues.

I like the V8 Charger a lot, thanks. No issues at almost 4,000 miles.

There is certainly much to like about the S3, for me.
However, the price is quite high when well equipped,
to me \ from my point of view.

For example:
Although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds I associate with the price point. Ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but I prefer more immediate torque delivery from low RPM. It does pull well, once RPM & boost climb. The DCT & final drive gearing requires much, MUCH higher RPM in top gear at cruising speeds than I prefer.

The interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.

The sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. Here in HotLanta, that is really not a good idea. . .

Although handling inspired confidence, I agree regarding the ride quality. Part of that may also be the S3’s relatively short wheelbase.

The interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were comfortable and supportive. With full leather seating, I do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the Charger – and it works really well!

I liked the fact that the S3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. I do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.

Clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences.
That’s all I recall – last drove one in December.

- Ray
Quite happy with my current choice . . .
I agree with your review of the S3.

They should have used the amazing 7-speed DSG unit from the S4, not the same old 6-speed dating from 2006. That would solve your RPM at high cruising speed dilemma.

They should offer an option to forego the sun/moon roof, save a grand, and save the hassles of an improper cover.

We went out for a long drive on familiar twisty (and in great condition) secondary roads. I went first at my wife's insistence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) AWD car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.

As I am familiar with the road where a sign indicating 15 MPH (right turn corner) is the correct speed, according to the Ohio DOT, to navigate the turn, I know my non-TV equipped S4 can take said curve @ 45 MPH. Therefore I assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (I do not have these) and the TV option, the TV equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 MPH without drama.

I was proven correct in that I easily took this ""curve"" at 54 MPH with help from what feels like it could be ""The Hand of God."" Entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, NOT accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when I reached the apex of the corner, I dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.

The rear end of the car was seemingly grabbed by a giant foam rubber hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually drama free. Speed? Yes? A bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? Oh hell yes!

Next up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer's decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. Once again, almost counter-intuitively I entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where I cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""

Again, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.

A couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""

Up next, my wife -- our idea was this: I drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). My left curves were her rights, and so on.

Once she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling TV the hand of god.

I guess, other than sharing this with y'all, I would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" Someone once said, ""nothing else even comes close.""

I am ""OK"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, I will never get another car (on purpose) without it. The Acura's SH-AWD is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: It is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.

So while I admire and recommend only getting an Acura equipped with SH-AWD, if you're looking at the brand, I can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of TV in the S5 I drove this weekend.

Too bad I'm not in the market -- for an S4 thusly equipped would be sick.

Drive it like you live.

Mark, reporting from somewhere in Cincinnati -

I've long said that the Sport Rear Diff should be standard on all Quattro Audi's, especially S models like the S4. Whoever decided that making moon roofs standard was more important for about the same price as the Rear Diff option should be shot. How can anyone choose navigation or sun roof over the torque vectoring? I'm dumbfounded.

I've seen some of the ""delete"" options, and while they allow it, they don't change the price.

I purchased an Audi 5000CS quattro some time ago (it had 15,000 miles on it). The window sticker was in the glove box -- the car had wool seats (with a delete leather seats, noted on the sticker). I liked the seats, even though I am not a fan of seats that cannot simply be wiped with a damp cloth -- but I bought the car previously owned, after all.

I assume wool seats must be the default in Europe, but this was not a gray market car -- it was a regular US spec 5000CS with pearl paint (optional) and delete leather seats (a no cost option).

Since sunroofs are only ""standard"" in some markets, I have to assume that the decision to include a sunroof in the US is the fact that we Americans want sunroofs and EXPECT them and perhaps would not like seeing a sunroof (which is a right, after all) with a line item with a charge on it on the window sticker.

I wonder if there is an economy of scale making the bundling of options for a particular market a way to both increase profits for the US (for instance) arm of the company and to somehow suggest that the content of the car is actually higher than competing models.

Friend of my wife just went test driving Audi and BMW. Configured two cars as close to identical as the web site configurators would allow; the BMW's MSRP rose more quickly than the Audi's, even though they seem to be comparable when ""stripped"" (which is due to the fact that the Audi has more content than the BMW in base form). Then the BMW surges past the Audi when the option boxes are checked off in an attempt to keep the cars as close as possible in terms of their equipment levels.

I don't know if anything was actually proven, but her friend ended up with a 2016 A6 3.0T Sline Prestige for about the same price as a 4-cylinder BMW 5 series with a couple fewer options. The BMW seemed to shoot up in price as the attempt to content it like the Prestige package moved forward.

But this may be an example that isn't typical -- maybe the BMW is comparable assuming you don't put ventilated seats, heads up display, sport package and LED headlights on it -- I find the configurators take a lot of work to pull together comparable equipment levels (and maybe that's the point.)

I tried doing this with a Porsche Macaan vs an Audi SQ5 -- the Porsche dealer said the differences in price for content were very small. My calculations came up with about a $15,000 difference. Maybe that is what Porsche figures is a small difference.

Hell, at these price points, price isn't really the main selling factor -- after all, if what we wanted was a lot of bang for our bucks, we'd all buy KIA's, yes?"

According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""

Increasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.

The off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. We've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.

I don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.

My wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount. A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday. Wham bam, thank you m'am.

Now, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling. I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.

But, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?

Clearly, there is something wrong with me.

I am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. See, something's just not right with me.

The last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. Well, sure, I thought, you're in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich. Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted. Is this still European practice?

Anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all."

Mark - interesting points you make. As a moderator here at Edmunds, I help folks with lease numbers (MF and residual). Often the question comes up about picking a car that is a good deal - I often reply with something along the lines of ""when you're looking at a $30K / $40K / $50K / $60K car, why wouldn't you get exactly what you want rather than what the dealer has on the lot?""

When we bought my wife's Outback in February, she wanted a specific color and option group. Fortunately, a local dealer had one coming in equipped exactly that way, so it was a fairly easy transaction. But, should I find myself in the market for a car with that price range, I'd have no problem ordering it to my exact specs.

Bingo. There is something in current American culture that prevents people from waiting for anything. That was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved. Instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want. One would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost ""unamerican"". I literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when I said I (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months. ""Why would you wait?"", they asked.

I think there is a strong feedback loop in this - people want an instant gratifications, so the dealers and manufacturers adjusted to that world view by taking large inventories of product (nowhere else in the world car dealers have such enormous inventory) - which in turn conditions them to attempt to push for sales of what they already have (financing cost of the inventory) rather some future product that may even get canceled. Sale can be really booked when when the product and funds changes hands, not when order is made and just a small deposit is made. The finality of spot delivery gives a lot of incentives to everybody involved to accept what is there, rather than what may be there. This of course creates sales people with blank stares and puzzled looks when they meet a ""pickey"" cutomer (like me), who wants an exact color, style and options and is willing to wait for it. Customers know that, too and they know their power of instant gratification works the other way, as well as their own. Unit taken off the lot today, is one with no more financing cost.

I always read that an ordered car should be less expensive than one from the lot, because it's not financed. This is true in theory, but the psychology works in exactly opposite direction. The sales people act like they're making you a favor by accepting a future order rather than taking the car from the lot (and for reasons stated above, they may even believe that), which means you should pay for that ""favor"". If you were more ""accommodating"" to their immediate needs (take one unit from the lot), they may be more ""accommodating"", too. As a result, some people who would be willing to wait hear they could get extra $1000 off the car on the lot (even if it doesn't make any sense from cost-plus point of view), so they adjust their expectation and take one with a different color or wrong options, just so they can believe they got a better deal. It even works for them long term, as such a customer, who bought a ""deal"" may be more willing to accelerate next purchase, as they may never get over that color, or those wrong options.

That's how the feedback loop closes - since people are willing to accept ""imperfect"" product, why change the business model that ""works""?

Depends. It may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited. Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations). Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null. I'd like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching, dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I'm flexible on wheels. No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO. There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many. Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply. Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration. It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships. I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. They seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and accents that BMW charges you extra 2 grand. I disagree, but who am I?

Same thing, Benz - there may be 50 or 100 units in C-class on a local major dealer lot (TB Mercedes), yet ZERO (literally) with real leather, all that fake stuff. This is how it were at some point, anyway - perhaps today they have one, who knows. That's what people buy, they say. It may be true. Leather is expensive at Benz and the fake stuff looks ""just as good"" - so they say. I wouldn't know, as there isn't even a single one to inspect.

3013,markcincinnati,April 2015,"Good point about ordered cars costing less than on-the-lot cars. My wife ordered a 2005 and a 2008 BMW X3 and the sales rep was quick to inform her that an ordered car gets an immediate MSRP discount of $500 (maybe it was $300, I don't remember exactly) since the dealership won't have to pay ""floorplanning"" (a.k.a., interest) fees.

I've not even attempted to order an American car, although when I test drove a new CTS, I got the sense ""it would not be necessary,"" since ""anything"" could be found using the dealer locator software. I didn't pursue this path, so I don't know how accurate that statement was.

At my dealership, my salesrep claims he would rather send people out on test drives of the various models and then sign up new customers to order the exact cars they want. He says this is because so many of their cars are ""on allocation."" Apparently, this means you will allocated so many A7's (for instance) and that is it -- be guided accordingly. This excludes ""ordered"" cars.

The Audi leasing system devalues Prestige Audis residuals, so the dealers, knowing that the vast majority of the cars they sell will be leased, order in Premium Plus models which have higher residuals, hence lower monthly payments. My wife wanted (hold on) the heated cup holder in her 2014 SQ5 -- guess what? Only comes on the Prestige model (of course). The tracking headlights, too, Prestige only.

We got around the lease penalty by buying the car @ 2% APR -- no lease residual hit. I'm assuming, however, that the trade in value will be lower since the car has virtually everything on top of being a Prestige.

Here's another issue with the current American Way of buying: there is virtually no opportunity to experience certain options, since the dealer rarely stocks cars with (for example only) Blind Spot Monitoring or Top View Camera, etc. Also it is virtually impossible to find a car with sports seats in stock since ""sport seats"" only come on cars equipped with ""summer only"" tires and here in SW Ohio, no one wants summer tires, and so on.

The Munich dealer, on the other hand, seemed to have at least ONE of everything (to test, but not to buy) so that the customer could see it, feel it, hear it, experience it and drive it.

I'm not sure what ""oh so special Europe"" suggests, but it seems somewhat of a dis. I'm not saying the [apparent] ""European way"" should be adopted here in the US. Most folks seem happy with buying off the lot -- to each his/her own self be true --and the cars that I want can still be ordered exactly as I want them, so we do have a system that certainly seems like it's working.

As a further point of clarification, hundreds of thousands of people -- check that, millions of people -- build new houses (or they hire companies and contractors to do so). I realize that many of these built houses are from ""Home Building"" companies that offer customers ""The Pemberton,"" ""The Gladstone,"" and ""The Barrington"" (or some such names) that are floor-plans that allow some customization (kind of like a car). There are also custom ""Home Builders"" that will build it entirely your way. And, there are local builders who offer highly customizabel houses based on a couple dozen blueprints. Even those who do not build their houses from the dirt up typically shop until they find the facing and floor-plan that satisfies certain criteria. Some folks take months and months of house hunting before they pull the trigger on a $400,000 house, but will turn around and buy a $40,000 car after a 15 minute test drive (and they buy car after car after car the same way). Some folks probably spend more money on cars over a 20 to 30 year real estate mortgage term than they do on the house they call home -- always settling for what's on the lot.

It's just a statement of fact that in the US we pay much less for cars, but in turn we have to accept limited choices provided by the manufacturers (like only 2 gas and 1 diesel engine on 3-series sedan, even less choice on other body styles, no manual transmissions, etc.), which is even more narrowed by dealers due them stocking only what they believe they can sell quickly - and customers wanting to drive away with the car at the day of the transaction, not in six weeks, not even in next day, or two. It's all part of the system, a tradeoff for significantly lower prices. Again, I don't blame them, just stating the fact. The reason of those systems evolving that way are many, some cultural, some geographic, some legal, some economic. In overall, I'll take lower prices for less choice every day of the week - but it doesn't prevent me from wishing there was more choice, at the same price, of course . But as a realist I know ain't gonna happen.

Agreed on that one. Yes, it would suck, if the car died. However, the arrangements can be made, like buying a cheap car for time being (it is of course much more hassle, but I once almost did just that). I also think there are ways to prevent most of sudden deaths of vehicles, at least maintenance-related. An accident or act of nature with a total would be one that may not be fully preventable.

Another reason for European market being the way it is, stems from simple price-to-income relationship. Cost of a new car may be there in similar proportion to our cost of house. People buy and keep them for much longer, they cost more not just in dollars, but even more in relation to their earnings power. When you see that, it's easy to understand why somebody would get exactly what they want. If one trades cars every three years, there is always ""next time"" for the dream car, whatever it actually means.

Depends. It may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited. Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations). Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null. I'd like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching, dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I'm flexible on wheels. No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO. There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many. Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply. Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration. It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships. I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. They seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and accents that BMW charges you extra 2 grand. I disagree, but who am I?

Same thing, Benz - there may be 50 or 100 units in C-class on a local major dealer lot (TB Mercedes), yet ZERO (literally) with real leather, all that fake stuff. This is how it were at some point, anyway - perhaps today they have one, who knows. That's what people buy, they say. It may be true. Leather is expensive at Benz and the fake stuff looks ""just as good"" - so they say. I wouldn't know, as there isn't even a single one to inspect.
Depends as you said. Local MB dealership has:

101 CLA Class in stock - 22 with leather 22%
109 C Class in stock - 38 with leather 35%
91 E Class in stock - 60 with leather 66%
986 Total in stock - 457 with leather 46%

Notice as the base price goes up, more leather in stock.

Dealers stock what people want. It's a $2300 upcharge for leather in the C300. That's 6%. I would guess that more than half of all C's are leased. The C300 leases at that magical price of $399 a month. Add another $50 a month for leather and it crosses that threshold where some folks start to get nervous."

Here's another issue with the current American Way of buying: there is virtually no opportunity to experience certain options, since the dealer rarely stocks cars with (for example only) Blind Spot Monitoring or Top View Camera, etc.
That is exactly my experience, too. I had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life. Another example is dynamic handling package or 3/4-series. Sounds good, especially on X-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and M-sport lines. NOT A SINGLE unit available with that, across the board - 3-series, 4-series, sedan, coupe, whatever. ZERO. How do I spend, or not spend $1000, if I don't even know what it actually brings? The significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act.

Americans can and probably should be ridiculed for many things but the way they buy cars should be way, way down the list.
I did not say a ""million per year"" -- but that technicality was not really the point. The spirit of what I was saying was simply that cars, like houses, are very expensive purchases, yet we seem (to me, and I am only speaking for me) to buy these expensive durable goods with (what I perceive) not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure.

But, perhaps the system is set up that way -- folks go to the auto dealership thinking they want a dark blue metallic car with an ecru interior but, for the sake of -- what? -- expediency end up with gloss black paint and a light gray interior.

All I am saying (about myself) is I grew up in the 1960's when a brand new Chrysler Newport was under $4,000 -- which, for my parents, was a HUGE purchase. Since it (the 1963 Chrysler Newport) was my parent's first new car ever, they wanted (god knows why) seafoam metallic (a kind of medium green with a shiny tinge to it), automatic transmission, an AM radio with a rear seat speaker, a rear window defroster and power steering and power brakes. My parents thought (I assume) since they were ""spending a young fortune"" they should get exactly what they wanted, not necessarily just what was on the lot.

That mode of thinking stuck with me. Me -- not you, not other 'mericans, apparently.

My way is not correct for anyone else but me (but it might be, for all I know) -- it is, however, not incorrect.

Considering it would be less expensive if we ordered cars and considering that ordering a new car is almost the only way to get exactly the car you want, I simply struggle with the notion of ""test drive and buy today."" Clearly cars are bought in less than logical or even financially advantageous ways. Makes some sense, though, since cars are very emotional ""things"" -- or, better said, ""cars make US, emotional and irrational.""

Here's another ""shocking"" data point -- my friend who owns several car dealerships claims that less than 50% of people even bother to test drive a car anymore. I assume (doesn't make it so) this must have something to do with the age of the Internet.

I leave you as a product of my time -- which had its formative years in the '60's and '70's, apparently."
3022,dino001,April 2015,"I think that claim of your friend's is based on observation that many of his purchases are based on customer walking in and buying without testing.

He always creates some fake justifications, how this pretending is not in conflict with his proclaimed christian faith (like ""I may be interested in this car in 20 years"", or equally ridiculous notion).

3028,markcincinnati,April 2015,"My wife and I certainly are regularly and frequently entertained by test driving. But there is actually a legitimate purpose too. Now, remember I said we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/SUV's that we are pretty certain we would NEVER buy. For instance, much as I might be entertained by driving a Corvette, I know in my heart of hearts I'd never buy one (even with your money). I just don't bother test driving them, therefore.

I have test driven an X6 -- and NOW, I know I wouldn't buy one, but at the time, it did seem like it was possible. Also test drove an Acura ZDX, for the money, it was better than the X6, but, for the money, I'd go with an MDX and pocket the $10,000. Likewise, I just CAN'T justify an Audi A7 or S7 when, since I have driven both, there is an A6 and S6 that are as far as I am concerned identical. Now, I do like the looks of an A7, but not $10,000 more than I like an A6, and so on.

I tested a couple of Jeeps (even the SRT 8 version) whilst we were shopping for the SQ5.

I can't see myself testing a Malibu -- just not interested, nothing against the car, per se, just not for me.

Same with a KIA Soul (is that spelled correctly?) -- but I would try (and have) an Optoma and am interested in a Genesis as a possible old-fart's alternative to an A6 for when I am 73, not 63, perhaps. And so forth.

I don't want to waste the dealer's time nor my time -- but test driving is both good education and good fun (or at least it can be both).

I'll not be testing a VW bug anytime soon, but I have tested the Toureg (and the Cayenne) and the Q7, too -- a VW CC sure is purty and in AWD trim could be #11 on my top 10, so to speak.

Within reason -- REASON -- I would think dealers need as many folks of means testing their cars as they can get their hands on. My wife and I test drove an Acadia a number of times -- came moderately close to moving on it, instead went with a 2011 FX35 (Infiniti).

If ""y'all"" want to comment with both an informed and entertained perspective on this forum, I would think that, plus your love and passion for cars would make you want to carve out at least one weekend every other month or so for test drive after test drive after test drive.

But, on the other hand, kids, in-laws, dogs and cats, broken pipes and blown A/C compressors can sometimes get in the way of the 'serious bidness' of test driving cars [for a living].

Most people buy houses and suits off off the rack too. Like cars, the % of people that design, build and wait is pretty small.

Some people also buy because they need a car quickly. Others aren't that picky about ever option, as long as it looks good, and has the important stuff. Or with a Honda, they are all the same!
Our home was bought new, and the builder allowed some changes to be made to the interior of the house, Rick is seeing more and more builders allowing these changes to be made. So we did get the house we wanted, without playing the construction loan convert to conventional loan game.. We have a friend who did this in Carmel Calif, a very nice, very upscale seaside town in northern calif. After the house was completed at a cost of 6 million dollars the appraiser did not appraise the house at that price, so no loan.. Now, the house sits on a bluff over looking the pacific ocean, the dinner room, kitchen and family room each have 90 to 120 degree view of the ocean, it's simply breathtaking. So he is paying on a construction loan for now and working with 3 banks to convert this loan... Building a house is not the same as building and waiting 4-6 week for your car to come in.

It's the same instant gratification. The salesman gets paid when he sells stuff today. The order is in the future. It can be canceled. The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops. The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it. The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions. They essentially already decided for us what we want.

The German brand salespeople are usually well trained to accept orders and act like they're happy about it (even if they preferred to sell us something from the lot). Moreover, they generally have a system where every car has an order behind it (it usually is a sales manages, sometimes actual customer). They even have some ""special order"" options (like colors) that require actual end customer for production (managers sometimes create a virtual Joe Smith to work the system).

Try make an order at a Honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger. Not to mention that Honda itself simply doesn't build ordered cars - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then MAYBE you get lucky when one of those cars will be what you ordered. There is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations.

BTW, those who make argument that order should be cheaper because it doesn't cost as much (no financing), it's true only in theory. In aggregate, all cars pay for the financing, including those that did not bear that direct cost. Also, if that logic was correct, a ""lot queen"" sitting there for months should have a premium sticker slapped onto it to cover that interest - but it's quite the opposite, isn't it? Because pricing decisions are only loosely linked to actual cost. The other parts are demand, psychology, planning, volume incentives, etc.

Look at the option list for a 3-series, then for an Accord. Big difference. Really, the only ""options"" are for dealer added accessories. You want leather for your LX? Sure, here's the Katzkin catalog. Can't get it from the factory. At all.

But you can option up a 320i to $45K if you tick all the boxes.

It's not comparing apples to oranges. More like apples to coffee tables.
I look at the Japaneses car companies at making appliances, you can't option out a washer, just move up to higher model. That is what the Japanese do, want leather in an Accord, then move up to the EX-L, if you are looking at the LX but want sunroof, you need to move up the higher model that might come with equipment you don't want. Lexus and Infiniti does this too.

IF you want a 320i, but want leather and sunroof, you can do that and stay in the 320i model, if you want a 320i with sport package and manuel transmission yup, you can stay with the 320i... Sure I can go and purchase a fully loaded Accord EX-V6 for 35K, but it's still an appliance..."

yeah, on a Honda it is just a matter of doing a search for the specific model and color combo. Which is almost always out there someplace.

only exception might be if you are holding out for a stick shift. There may be a few theoretical configurations (like a Navi) that don't exist in reality.
You haven't been to the Honda Website in a while... BTW there are more then a few theoretical configurations you can't get at honda.. Some are classic color combo's.

If you love Black or Grey leather interior then the Accord is your car, They do not have Tan in the sedan, and I doubt they have it in the coupe either. In the lower range Accord, they only offer it in two colors, Grey and Steel., you have to move up to and above the EX=L to get other body colors.

Acura is the same, the have a limited selection of color combo's, if you want a MDX with a blue exterior, then you will have to settle for black or grey interior.

I was aware of that. Current situation is a result of years of ""streamlining"". I probably should have chosen Toyota as my example, as those guys have much more elaborate option structure, yet the ordering mindset is just like Honda's, not BMW's.

It's probably both, self-feeding feedback loop. Because dealers have large inventory and expensive infrastructure to support they will always prefer ""bird at hand"" (aka instant gratification), they push more for it. The consumers know it, so they adjust behavior accordingly. Of course then dealers claim ""it's what customers want"". The gratification of actually driving the car the same day and having the interest payment stopped helps, of course.

Honda and Acura are at least honest about it: some things simply don't even exist in their catalogs. I can deal with that - if it's not there, it's not there. The problem is, others (Toyota, Ford, Mazda) have myriad of combinations ""available"", but units on dealers' lots are ""what sells"" (understandable) and salespeople are not very receptive to order talk (not understandable). BMW and Benz will usually gladly take an order. It seems VW dealers stay more on the ""popular brand"" side, i.e. it's as Roadburner said, ""cold fusion"" difficult.

My other problem is, if not a single lot unit has certain type of option (like suspension) that is essential to the way the vehicle feels, how in the world can know whether or not I want it?

VW's problem was they alienated their old customers, but initially gained some ground on their cheaper and dumbed down models, but ran out of steam. My guess is people figured out that if you want a Corolla clone, better get the original. To me VW is a cautionary tale to BMW. You may have an early success, such as a new Jetta and Passat had, but this doesn't guarantee long run.

BTW, I read somewhere that new then Jetta and Passat were responses on dealers screaming for a car ""for Americans"". I guess beware what you wish for...

I remember, clearly, the first time a dealer sent me home in a new car the very day I signed the papers. It was in the evening, I was financing through my credit union, which of course wasn't open. I was like, ""How can you give me the keys and let me drive it home when you haven't been paid yet?""

And then there was the first time a dealer told me to take it home for the weekend, see if I liked it, bring it back on Monday (or sign the papers if I wanted to keep it).

IT works for them because the buying public allows it to happen. What would happen if Honda's sales would drop say, 13% a year and market research shows that people want to be able to order their cars? Would Honda change?

How about color choice? As I posted if you want a top level Accord, hope black is your favorite color as that is the only color. Anything from EX-L up is limited in color too.. Not too sure what you mean by, "" you can get pretty much what you want."" In the domestic market you can order separate items, but the trick is finding a dealer that is willing to do it.

I would have no problem paying a somewhat premium for a Teutonic (and it doesn't even have to be made in Germany) driving vehicle with a really nice interior - you know, like the early 2000's Jetta and Passat. What I'm tired of (and I owned a Jetta in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. High parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. So I really liked the late '90's/early 2000's VWs and nearly bought a Passat as it was much like my '90 Audi A4 - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ELLPS. Fast forward to the later 200x's and the Passat is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. It's more like an American car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and VW service network. That IMHO is why VW has missed the boat. And also agree that they are slow to respond."

According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""

Increasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.

The off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. We've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.

I don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.

My wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount. A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday. Wham bam, thank you m'am.

Now, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling. I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.

But, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?

Clearly, there is something wrong with me.

I am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. See, something's just not right with me.

The last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. Well, sure, I thought, you're in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich. Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted. Is this still European practice?

Anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all.
The 2014 S4 Order form I used to customize my order for the 2014 S4 didn't have a ""delete Moon-roof"" option written on it. I suppose I should have thought of ""writing in"" my specifications, but with no credit, I'd of probably hesitated to delete it. If they'd even give me $50 back I'd do it.

That is exactly my experience, too. I had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life. Another example is dynamic handling package or 3/4-series. Sounds good, especially on X-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and M-sport lines. NOT A SINGLE unit available with that, across the board - 3-series, 4-series, sedan, coupe, whatever. ZERO. How do I spend, or not spend $1000, if I don't even know what it actually brings? The significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act.
Agreed 100%. How can I choose a color if I haven't seen it in person; paper and monitors often don't come close to replicating actual colors. How can I decide if that 1,100 dollar adaptive S4 suspension is worth the money if there are none to test drive anywhere you go? Also was impossible to find the specs on how much weight, if any, the adaptive suspension adds (I assume it adds some).

I think this is the chicken and the egg scenario. Dumb car sale managers are controlling what Americans buy because most don't want to wait 6 to 12 weeks for their car. I know with Audi's, if you want what you want, you have to custom order; I'd estimate 90% of the time as dealer's don't like to trade Audi's.

I don't think those SM's are dumb. They just have an ""average"" mind for their average customer. At least Audi or BMW lets you order easily, which is a workaround. I can live with that and I'm even willing to pay, as long as the premium is reasonable. Other brands often take act of Congress.

There is, far as I know, no new ordering guide for 2016 A4's available yet.

But, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a NEW A4 and what will arrive is the NEXT MY. Far as I know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an Audi dealer and order up a new S4 Prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 B8 version, not the eagerly anticipated B9 morphed model.

At the rate of change that is POSSIBLE, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long. No wonder the A4 is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want THE NEXT, not THE CURRENT, especially if the CURRENT is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.

Now, I have had my 2014 about a year and a half. I have 25K miles on it. I love this car. I am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35K miles with improved shoes.

I am hoping on a major evolution in the A4 model line as it goes from B8 to B9, and I guess the thing to do is to get the NEW version within the first 2 or 3 MY's into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.

I assume my current S4's durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof. I will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week. I an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. And, I am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.

Subsequently, I plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change. Yet, I still assume I will have to order the car to my specs, but there's the fun, it's like getting a new car TWICE within 90 days.

And, BTW, someone wrote that cars on the lot are less expensive than ordered cars -- I guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and I've never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order. My rep says he would be fine -- financially, I assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.

I don't know anything about ""ordering"" Hondas, I would no more do that than I would order a new electric can opener, however. I'm partial to Oster's, if you care."
3085,robr2,May 2015,"I'm the one that wrote about VW's long product cycle. I have a B5 Passat. It was available for 1998 to 2005 - 8 model years with only a minor facelift in the 2001 model year. In today's competitive auto market, a car can't stay the same for that long.

Honda used to follow the 2 year minor facelift, 4 year major overhaul, 8 year new car. They have now stretched that to 3 and 6.

My understanding is that the 2016 Audi A4 B9 will be introduced in Frankfurt this September and will probably hit the US in early 2016.

I don't recall anyone saying it's cheaper to buy off the lot versus ordering. For the dealer principal/management, they would prefer you buy off the lot as they have an asset that is costing them money everyday. Just like any inventory intensive business, turning that inventory is key.

As for Hondas, your comment makes you seem a bit elitist. True, they aren't soul filled Teutonic machines with such tight tolerances that failure is inevitable . But they are fine automobiles that must be doing something right as they sell hundreds of thousands every year."

It's a ""wisdom"" often repeated in self-help books and websites, based on math of an individual unit cost (no financing cost), not considering overall inventory management economics and psychology of here and certain vs. future and maybe. It also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time frame, usually within a month or less. No dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer's cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash. The incentive may or may not be extended. This alone can put order in a thousand plus dollar disadvantage.

2018 430i Gran Coupe"
3088,markcincinnati,May 2015,"I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.

Honda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for. That last declaration can be applied to Hondas and Acuras, VW's and Audis and Nissans and Infinitis and Toyotas and Lexus cars.

To some extent, we all settle.

My opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for Hondas instead of Acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren't into cars that much. I work with folks who lease new Corollas every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn't worth getting a Lexus IS350 F-Sport AWD. They see no merit in cars, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/ Across the hall is another ""cars are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. We also have an empty nester two high income couple who love Acuras. The last player in our small group loves Minis and is as passionate about the brand as I am about Audis.

It takes all kinds.

I would not, on purpose, go to Honda for a new car -- I did dip my toe into Honda in 2012. The Accord line is nice -- but personally, I found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.

I am 63, at this point in my life I find myself repeating ""life's too short"" whenever I consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.

Every appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilitarian aspect. We bought three Whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher. Dishwasher number four was a Bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not.

The point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you. If you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) cars, you'll probably be compelled toward the ELLPS and LPS models many of us go on about here. If you'd rather have a new Viking range and a new Sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren't made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage. I have no quarrel with that.

If you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an LPS car, go for that.

Settle on the things you don't care about and don't settle on the things you do.

This is not the entire extent of what I have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.

That is why I say: Drive it like you live..

So far, I do not have to settle on a Honda or a Toyota -- but it doesn't mean if you do that I don't respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you'll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever)."

3090,graphicguy,May 2015,"I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area. As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago.

Knowing that the ""NEW"" C Class was on its way, I told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 C. But, everyone knew the new C was just around the corner, so the dealers and Mercedes were really aggressive pricewise in selling the '14s.

Anyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local Mercedes dealer that was obviously culled from my company's database showing what I'm sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger). They were having some private showing of a GTS. I ended up on the list to attend a ""look see"".

Clearly, they didn't have access to my salary info if they thought I was a target customer for the AMG GT-S. But, I had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....I'll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it. IF they let me drive it....even better.

I'll cut to the chase. They didn't let me drive it. Got to sit in it, though. I hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these cars have. But, I guess the very high end cars are all getting them, Mercedes AMG is no exception.

Can't really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.

As I wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, I spied a humble C-Class outside. Steel Grey with Red Leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff Mercedes tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it's not). This wasn't the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl. Sales guy spots me, asks me what I thought. Told him I liked the color combo better than any I'd seen so far.

At the Autu Show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour. This one, was quite different. Very pretty. Sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before I knew he had left. ""Go for a spin?"".

""I'm not in the market"".

Sales-""I'd rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""

""Fair enough"".

It's taken me awhile, but I've finally wrapped my head around sports sedans with 4 cyl. Actually, these turbo motors really do amaze me. They're torquey. More fuel efficient. Lighter. And generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl cars I've had recently. Truth told, they're pretty damned quick in their own right.

This one is no different. I don't know the specs, but it's typical. No turbo lag that I could ascertain. Quick off the line. Pulled hard over a broad RPM range. It was quieter than the growl my CTS gives off (which I like). 7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this. It's smoother than my CTS trans, but I've got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (GM KNOWS how to make a good automatic trans).

C Seats I really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seats in the TL SH AWD. The Benz felt tailored to me. I think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.

My CTS seems faster, but again, the C is no slouch. CTS suspension is geared more towards handling. C is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own. At least that's the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.

Now, my CTS interior is no slouch in the build and materials category. Real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best GM has ever done with any car they've built........EVER!

C Class is over the top, especially at the price point. Again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as I just had seen in the AMG just 30 minutes earlier. They felt the same, too. Mercedes leather is better than Cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself. Porous wood, is better than CTS polished wood (which again, is really, really good).

I didn't like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"". Cadillac does a much better job. I don't like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that's a Mercedes trade mark (really?). My CTS is bigger, but hte C felt more comfortable.

Final thoughts. The C stickered for right around $50K. Their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44K-$45K range. At that price? A very compelling car. The interior is what would sell it. It's competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, A, etc. ATS is edgier (as is my CTS).

Maintenance? Included with Cadillac for 4 years. Way cheaper than Mercedes after warranty period, too.

I'd consider one on my next pruchase...probably put it near the top.

We all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing. And, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the Honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an Acura. They settle for the Honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ELLPS or LPS. Things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds.

The family that has $50,000 to live on is little different from the family that has $100K to live on -- if you ask them, they will somehow tell you how they choose to live within their means (or they mortgage everything to the hilt, cars included).

I have lived with a relatively small income up to a ""middle class"" to ""upper middle class"" income -- at every way station, I have always felt I had to ""settle"" on something, either the cars or the home appliances or the monthly mortgage.

I am not suggesting that settling is somehow a bad thing. If one had a cushion of $10 million in the check book, I would assume it would be possible for that person to see virtually no barriers to a car purchase,

Personally, I couldn't see spending even $100K on a car, even with the financial impunity to do so.

Mark.....all good points.

I was just having this conversation with my best friend. He has a $70K '15 Corvette, that for the most part, sits in his garage gathering dust. He drives a new Suburban every 2 years....I'll assume those are at least in the $50K range with discounts...probably closer to $65K with the new version. His wife drives an Infiniti M something....assume mid $50s on that. So, in short, he has roughly $185K tied up in vehicles,,,,,,,RIGHT THIS MOMENT.

He's in my tax bracket. Not Soros money, nor even failed Silicon Valley start up money. But, enough that we're not too worried about going into a dealership and buying something like a brand new Corvette as an impulse buy.

His philosophy? Spend it all while alive and healthy. He has no kids. He was an only child. So, outside of his wife, he really has no other outlet to spend his money (or even save for college tuition, teen insurance rates, etc). In short, the only thing he has to worry about is staying relatively healthy.

Some worry and sweat every purchase, whether it's that new leather recliner, or whether to buy a Honda or an Acura. They have kids. They have huge tuition bills staring at them. I get that. I've been there.

I'm 10 years before I think about retirement. So, that's something I think about, but certainly doesn't occupy a lot of my time. I think I'm good, but who knows what will happen over the next decade.

Would it make a major financial lifestyle change if I bought a Z06 Corvette? Nope. The only question I'd ask myself is ""what else could you do with that money?""

I see my son, who has a good job in IT. He works for a major University, so his job is secure, probably as long as he wants to stay there. He's wanting a new WRX. He's fretting over how it will affect his lifestyle currently. As I told him, budget it up. If it would get in the way of your savings plan as it stands right now (I actually showed him how to budget for just about everything and anything), then don't do it. If you can do all the things you're doing now, put all the eggs in the baskets you've set up. then go for it.

Who I feel for are the folks who are busting their tails to make ends meet. Their budget is sliced so thin, that tomorrow is only a hope that they've got enough to feed their family healthily. If their 10 year old Caravan has a major issue, it will mean a large change in a lifestyle that can ill afford any negative changes and is begging for anything positive. They can't afford a new car (although dealers would love to get them in and finance them at their high rates). They're the ones who need a new car the most.

On the other end of that spectrum, there's my other colleague, who has a 12 year old TL....250K miles. We both get a healthy car allowance....BUT...only if the car is 3 years old or less and is on their ""list"" of approved vehicles. He bought the TL used a decade ago and is having fits about how much ""cars cost"" today. If he could drive a used Tercel and pocket the car allowance, he'd be happy. And yes, he can afford any car he wanted....including those $100K cars you speak about.

I fall in the middle. I like the nicer cars. but have my own definitions on what I'll spend money on. I like nice cars, but not ones that cost $60K (unless that $60K car was an overwhelming value at that price). I'll put a limit set at $55K. I've long given up the notion of any car as something that's anything more than an expense to me. It's a depreciating asset. Truthfully, it's not even an asset in my mind. Plain and simple, it's an expense.

You find that in many major cities. People don't own a car because they don't have to. Everything you need, including transportation is right outside your door. In NYC, you might consider having one if one lived in Brooklyn, Queens, or Staten Island. The further away from Manhattan, the more likely someone may own a car.

Here in Boston, they are encouraging NOT owning a car. The newest residential projects are expected to have limited parking and easy access to T stations, ZipCar locations, and Hubway bike sharing stalls. The newest neighborhood under redevelopment is the Seaport district. What was once a desolate area of piers with a couple of restaurants is now a vibrant area with offices, pharmaceutical labs, restaurants, shopping, apartments, museums, and a convention center. Yes there is parking but it's not easy to find and it's not cheap.

I know that might seem crazy to you in Dayton but it's the model that crowded northeastern cities have to take."

It's not just that. It seems they are repackaging things. It still depends on the prices, but I actually like some of the moves - 340 (more hp, so they can bump up the number) gets premium package standard, which is how it should be - I just hope the price differential between 328 and 340 won't get prohibitive. They get Sport Line aesthetic features standard into 328 (SEATS!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board. There will also be track package, not really my thing, by I understand why some will go for it. I bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option.

I like the changes. I have no illusions on pricing, it will go up, but at least so will content. This is a typical mid-cycle refresh that adds value to a model. I'm sure 4-series GC will get it, too at some point, hopefully also in 2016, perhaps just a few months later. It will be between 440 GC and 328 wagon (I'm sure there is no 340 wagon coming). I bought my current as last year of the model, where some optional things were added to increase the appeal. Seems similar thing is happening again. The option schemes and packages was one of things I didn't care for in the new model. Now they gave me a reason to wait.

Obviously, I'm sure the ATS-V would solve that, and while the real world selling price might be competitive, last I checked the stickers were ridiculous (I last checked in 2013).

3111,markcincinnati,May 2015,"News: Audi B9 coming -- but not exactly soon . . .

2016 A4/S4 will be unchanged from the 2015 model, which was unchanged from the 2014 which was unchanged from the 2013.

The A4 as we know it now will enjoy a SHORT model year (sort of).

The B9 A4 sales training (US) is scheduled for November with 2017 model cars arriving at dealers approximately in February of 2016.

My buddy at the Audi Connection here in Cincinnati showed me the email ""from corporate.""

The discounts on the 2016's will be, one would imagine, compelling -- how else will they be able to sell 'em?

Having said the above, the A4, even ""long in the tooth"" is a great place to spend miles and miles in. The S4 even more so -- with a bunch of incentives (my guess is the price will include a bunch of 'packages' in the Premium+ versions -- standard Nav, standard B&O, etc -- so for your $45K you may drive off in a $52K S4, which would be a helluva deal.)

Or perhaps for your $39K, you'll drive off in an all singing, all dancing loaded A4.

There will be those among you, however, that just won't be able to take the leap knowing that in some very few months later, the new and improved model will be for sale, meanwhile you've still got 42 months to go on your lease or note.

Decisions, decisions.

Everyday I get behind the wheel of my S4 it's like watching The Exorcist for the 128th time -- it just keeps getting better every time."

Having driven a Q40 in it's former G37 guise and owning a 2015 Legacy 2.5i Premium, I can tell you that these are 2 completely different vehicles. I can offer you a few pieces of advice. 1st, if you like the way the Legacy drives, then stay away from the Infiniti dealership. Just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local Infiniti dealer and see if I can trade in and break even on my Subaru (13K miles since 9/27/2015). Power from the Q40's 328hp V6 is plentiful while I'd describe my Legacy's power output adequate.

The Legacy will definitely be roomier inside. The interior is very well finished with high quality, soft touch materials everywhere. The legacy will ride smoother. I got my Legacy before the Eyesight was available. I originally wanted it the package is somewhat of a bargain at only $1200 or so, but I couldn't wait. I've also read that depending on your market, eyesight equipped cars are selling closer to sticker than non eyesight equipped cars. I really like the 18"" wheels on the Legacy Limited. I have cloth seats, but have driven a Legacy with leather and it was very nice.

More important than ""things"" are the other choices we make -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your MBA or JD or whatever). The thing is very few of us can ""have it all."" And, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all. My best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car. He searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car. He finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 Cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for. He is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to ALL of the magazines -- as I am. This guy knows chapter and verse specs about new cars, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old.

His ""settling"" on these rare cream puff cars allows him to spend lots of time on the west coast of Florida on a houseboat, sailing, fishing and sitting in the sun drinking a cold beer.

Whenever I get a new car, I take it to him and we go out for a long test drive -- with him behind the wheel. I can tell he loves the car and probably he hopes that when I get rid of it, he can be the next owner.

My wife and I work (long hours, typically), enjoy fine dining, wine, European travel and ELLPS cars. We probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an Audi RS7 ($120,000 MSRP). We'd have to settle on other things were we to go for the RS.

Instead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive cars (mine was $57K, hers $65K), we bought hers and leased mine. The burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in.

Our next door neighbor has a new 750 BMW -- and a Camry -- the Bimmer costs as much as both of our cars combined. The guy across the street has a Hyundai and a Yukon but also owns 1/5th of an airplane. We're all settling in our own ways. Cars are, for me, slowly, very slowly, beginning to be less important to me at 63 than they were when I was 50. My wife, oddly, seems to be picking up the slack -- wanting the highest HP she can get (within reason, of course).

LED lights on other BMW's is a $1900 option, and currently the price on a 328i is $3100. So $5K is very steep, and some people could careless about the LED's for $1900,,, I would have liked to see Xemon being standard on all BMW's, even the El Cheapo 320i.

A modified Toyota would be rare, but not newsworthy. The reason I mention this Toyota Corolla is that it was a Toyota being driven at a ""fun"" back road pace (FAST), which is definitely as rare of a sighting as I can think of.

Take the 15 South from Escondido towards San Diego.
Exit 15 on the West Bernardo Drive/East Pomerado Rd Exit. Take Pomerado East across the freeway.

Both W. Bernardo Drive and Pomerado go in a North/South direction, so you must turn left onto Highland Valley Road to go East/SE.

Prepare for one of the most scenic fun drives imaginable with very little traffic, even on a Friday afternoon.

My new favorite road, and it's probably just as fast at getting me home in an unimpeded S4 driven with advanced techniques as a traffic clogged 15 South.

3171,markcincinnati,May 2015,"Experience with this?

I'm closing in on new tires for my 2014 S4 (18"" wheels). I live where we have moderate winters -- typically very few snow days, and when we do, they last a day. I have no interest in taking my car to any track event. I am also, typically, not interested in swapping from summer only to winter tires and back.

We all think we're great drivers, no doubt. I drive on the Interstate Highway system here in SW OH, which is to say it is full of pot-holes and every spring the new pot hole crop becomes evident. It is like driving a freakin' obstacle course. Having said that, I do drive once weekly between Cincinnati and Columbus (200 miles round trip). Much of the trip the ambient speed is 80+, some of the trip is 90+.

I have H rated ""Grand Touring"" tires on the car -- OEM's. They have been OK.

My thought is to replace these tires with the Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06's. My wife's 2014 SQ5 has the ""last gen"" DWS's -- and they have been very good.

I'm thinking there is some evidence that the DWS 06's are an improved in every way version of the DWS's. There is little info I can find about the tires, although TireRack does seem generally to approve of them.

These tires are UHP's and will be W rated. Their lifespan should be quite good, if the DWS (prev model) is any indication.

Are the tires quiet? Do they improve turn in? Are they rounder than most? Etc?

If you have any personal experience with these on your ELLPS or LPS cars, I would be interested in your comments.

The issue is not so much the snow (coefficient of friction) but the things that happen to a ""summer performance"" tire when temps drop below 45F. So, while I could probably use and enjoy a summer tire in the summer (I had them on my 2009 A4), well, in the winter, the ride and handling characteristics of the car reminded me of ""driving on the rims."" The car exhibited what I call ""same day"" turning, and the ride and the sounds from the road were, for lack of a better term, ""brittle.""

We have moderate winters here in SW Ohio, moderate in terms of precipitation. But once it gets cold, it stays below 40 -- and, well, summer tires just become hard as a rock."
3176,markcincinnati,May 2015,"""Isn't your car leased?  How many miles do you have on it?  How many months/miles do you have left?""

Yes, my car is leased. I have 27,000 miles on it. I don't know what being leased or not has to do with replacing tires -- when the OEM's go, well, you replace them (unless you are within a very short period of end of lease).

My 2009 had Dunlop MAX Performance 19"" 35 series tires on it. They had become substantially ""not fun"" any more at 11,000 miles -- and were said (to me) -- to be pretty much useless by 15,000. I had a blowout (when the outside temp was single digit above 0F) and the tread was so far gone I went ahead and bought 4 instead of the two I would have purchased had they not been those summer only MAX Performance tires. I had a 36 month lease on that one and, well, I was into the lease perhaps 9 months at that point.

When you gotta go, you gotta go.

I am considering keeping this S4 out of lease -- considering. In any case, for the next couple of years, I want the best -- most fun -- rubber I can have on the thing, all things considered.

UHP all-seasons seem to be a reasonable compromise -- I'm just hoping someone here has DWS 06's and cares to comment.

This past weekend I had a 535d, our SA is trying his best to get two cars sales out of us as, so I was able to take the 535d for the weekend. I was sold before this weekend, but not sold enough to sign on the dotted line. I can see that being my next car, unless BMWNA imports the 435d.

""Normally?"" I'd say that the OEM tires may be good for anywhere between 12,000 and 36,000 miles. In the ELLPS class, often the tires are of the low profile, super sticky and stiff sidewall type which ""normally"" translates to relatively short tread wear. If you lease a German car, these days, it often comes with MAX performance summer only tires and those types have even less tread life since they offer very soft tread in the pursuit of high cornering forces.

SW Ohio leases are typically 36 to 39 months and 15K per year. No way you could keep the OEM tires on the car, at least if you wanted to enjoy the last 6 to 12 months of ""ownership.""

I have leased, now, almost three dozen cars in my life -- I have ONCE kept the OEM tires on for the entire lease -- I leased a 1996 Audi A6 (for one year) while I awaited my 1997 A8 to arrive.

Now, my friend on the other hand, turned in his leased car with the original oil still in it. He just added a quart or two every once in a while and changed the filter a couple of times. It was an Acura that he ended up trading in on a BMW. He did, however, replace the tires twice (he commuted between Detroit and Cincinnati).

Just to make sure I wasn't smokin' sumthin', I called my dealer and asked how many customers replace the tires on their leased cars -- his answer was ""all of them."" He then said, almost all of those with leases over 12 months."

With absolutely no feedback coming through its steering wheel, the 228i is a bear to manage at its limits with stability control off, first understeering considerably, then flinging itself sideways at inopportune moments.

...more Buick than Bimmer. Every time we stop, the 228i's driver begs to get into something else.

I think that's why I'm anti-Audi right now. If they wouldn't have acted like posteriors, stepped up and taken care of the problems that they admitted to having, instead of jerking me around, they'd be on my shopping list.

So far, Cadillac has treated me as well/better as any other brand I've ever owned, that includes BMW, Audi, and Acura.

The CTS feels so solid, I can't quite see any parts flying off.
I don't mean to rub any salt in the wounds, but I think it's fair to ask that you share your updated ""review and aversions"" for Cadillac with the people that frequent this forum topic, as they might not be familiar with the other you've posted in.

Parts haven't flown off, but there's been other serious issues. My, what a difference a month makes! Nevermind the ""report back when and IF You get to 65K miles thing I said!""

Meanwhile, almost at 24K miles in the S4 and it hasn't needed any parts to be replaced by Audi yet. I have a long commute lately. The car is wicked fast and quick now that it's fully broken in. I did notice a hard grinding-like shift vibration/noise/misshifts by the DSG into reverse a couple of different mornings moving from a standstill. I'll keep an eye and ear on that.

I'll give you that the cars have improved, they just about had to as they had nowhere to go but up.

The products functionality was but one reason these companies were headed into the cesspool of failure though. The other problems still linger regarding durability, reliability, as well as for customer service, goodwill/good faith dealings, honesty, fairness, and that's a management and worker-bee issue.

It is my understanding GG was the Point of Contact for trying to get his Mother's Cadillac fixed/working? It might not have been his car, but it became his problem to deal with? Correct me if I""m wrong.

If I had a family member come up to me and ask to have me help them ""deal with"" Chrysler, I'd tell them their best course of action was to leave/abandon the car in Mexico with the doors unlocked and the keys inside.

Andres you keep beating a dead horse i.e GM and the Old Days, just like what you are doing with Chrysler.

The reason why GM was failing was the bean counter ran the company, it was cheaper to build one platform and have all brands use it, Caddy was dying because the generation who bought them where dying and people who had the money didn't want a front wheel drive Caddy that didn't drive well. That is why GM imported a Opal that could zig. Buick was dying for the same reason Caddy was, in the past 5 yrs both brands are enjoying a come back and I hope they continue, it only makes the competition better.

Chrysler (really Dodge) is doing the same thing, when MB bought them people were waiting for good things to come from that marriage, and it finally did the 300, but that was too late for MB, MB wanted Jeep and didn't care about everything else. Out of the that marriage MoPar got the independent suspension from the E class and their 5 spd transmission which made the 300 the success it was/is. Sure the Crossfire was an american version of the SLK.

I'm not too sure why you have to harp on GG, he has every right not to like Audi right now, allow him to do that. You love your S4, great, keep doing so. I'm glad we have a couple of Caddy owners here, I like to hear how they are holding up.."

I agree that more competition is better for the market overall.

I'm not harping on GG. I don't blame him for not liking Audi. Bad Customer service should result in lost customers. I like hearing from Caddy owners as well; the more information I have the better I say.

I just empathize with him because he's going through something I've sworn to avoid in my lifetime. One of the reasons I won't give Chrysler a 2nd chance is because I don't want to be in the weak position of having to fight them from being burned twice. I wouldn't have any patience for failures; however minor; so it's best I avoid them since I'd be a picky nitpicky customer for sure. They'd have to bend over backwards to keep me pleased.
My lifetime patience for an unreliable vehicles is all used up; no more in that tank.

3195,markcincinnati,May 2015,"The way I earn my living is by working with distributors of beverage alcohol products. For purposes of our discussions here, think of these distributors as your friendly local auto dealers.

I have come to learn that the distributors and suppliers have a love hate relationship. I must assume there is some similarity with auto mfgs and their retailers. Since I have been dealing with German car dealerships for the most part since 1977, my observation does not support this assumption. My Audi dealer seems to have a very positive relationship with Audi of America. My beverage alcohol customers seem to have no love lost relationship with their suppliers, however.

So, I do believe that my only matter of recourse, should I have an issue with my German car, is by dealing with my Audi dealer (at least first off). I have no issues with my dealership and we also had no issues with our three BMW's and the local BMW dealership. When something needed attending, the Audi and BMW dealership have always greased the skids, so to speak, to get the issue taken care of.

My few dalliances with American cars have, on the other hand, almost always had issues that the dealer wanted to get argumentative with. The same was true with Acura, but not with Infiniti. If someone says they have had issues with a GM or Chrysler car that required ""much"" effort to achieve resolution, well that seems, to me, to be justification for not patronizing American car dealerships. I've had the same experiences way back when I was in college and was trying to become a life-long Chrysler products customer.

My somewhat recent experience visiting a Chrysler/Jeep dealership in search of a new car, really did but one thing: I would, at this juncture, NEVER buy a Chrysler/Jeep product, as the experience made me feel the need for a shower -- and that was just going in for a test drive.

My preference is to work with what I have come to call ""horizontal"" car dealerships. The salespeople at such dealerships seem hell bent on discussing everything BUT the cars they presumably sell. Talk about zero pressure, zero stress, the German car reps seem, on a scale of 1 to 10 to place selling a car as number 11 on their list of things they want to do. One being the #1 thing they want to do.

Of course, the cynic in me assumes this could be part of a well studied act to make me believe they [the German dealership] really do care about what I want, rather than making a sale TODAY. In any case, I do respond to the negative pressure to buy. And, truth be told, I am not really all that concerned if this is all just contrived to manipulate me.

The guy I buy cars from is on my ""list"": you know the one that has a doctor, dentist, barber, accountant, lawyer, vet and a few other key individuals on it that we all rely on to keep us safe, sane, legal and well.

In my case, I happen to love German cars, Swiss watches, Italian shoes, and mostly Japanese electronics, and so on -- I have come to build relationships with folks who sell and support these products and services.

Nothing is perfect -- and I assume every product has lemons -- and because of this, I believe in relationships. If you buy into the notion that the stuff we buy we buy because of the service and support afforded us as consumers by the retailers, you should be shopping for the purveyor with as much care as you shop for the product itself.

My experiences -- after 33 Audis all from the same dealership -- have convinced me nothing else even comes close.

If you have an experience that you will -- on purpose -- repeat, I would urge you to at least consider doing so.

Most of the cars we discuss in this forum are more alike than not, if you find a great BMW or Cadillac dealership, I would urge you enjoy the benefits that you can glean via loyalty.

Finally, I'll leave you with this: one in a row is not a trend."

In fact, the Acura and Infiniti interiors, today, just seem a lot cheaper looking than those from Audi and Mercedes. The slow-but-steady improvements in BMW's interiors since 2010 or 2011 certainly bears noting; but today the two Germans I noted certainly seem to offer best in class interiors.

When my wife and I test drove a Macan recently (to get a sense of just how much Audi SQ5 it retained), we both felt the Porsche interior was somewhat more upscale than the Audi's. I don't know if all Porsche interiors come off feeling that ""high end"" or not -- and it may not even matter since the cars are not typically cross shopped.

The Sport line is now standard with the old sport line suspension as well as seats, in fact for $700 you can get the old DHP (Dynamic Handling Package) but the Variable Steering can be had on the standard Sport package, but can be had with the Track Package.

IF people do not want the Sport seats, then they just order the Luxury line which is a no cost options that comes with the old standard seats.

It's all relative. In their home world they have more then twice of engine choices, with option numbers just mind-boggling. American price sheet for the 3-series is three or four pages, the one in Europe is a 30 page booklet. So, in fact, American ordering is very simplified when compared with other markets. It's of course reflected in the pricing. I also know they run a system with dealers in full control of the ordering options within allocations, as opposed to many other manufacturers, who often push their choice of options on dealers. This of course means that people like me, who have taste outside of the ""mainstream"" are still at mercy of Joe, the dealer's ordering manager, but at least they allow to order anything that's on the list.

I've heard of Herb....mostly out East. But. I'd never heard of Moreno until he moved into the Cincinnati area. He's done well in the short time he's been down this way.

My guess is he's put a significant dent in the Cincinnati new Mercedes market by takig away business from the established player in Montgomery and West Chester.

Moreno was an intern at Automobile magazine and then worked for Saturn. Chambers hired in as the manager of his Saturn store and Moreno moved up to VP supervising 9 Chambers' locations. In 2005, MB offered to finance his purchase of a struggling dealership in Cleveland. Since then he has opened up 30 stores - MB, Porsche, Acura, Lotus, Aston, Infiniti.

MB only opens a store if they see potential for increased business. They wouldn't saddle a business with a $20 million building if it was a zero sum game. I'm guessing there was a demand for that open point as south of Cincinnati since the next closest store is in Lexington. His store here in my town was considered an open point. It's equidistant from two other MB stores (about 20 miles). It serves the suburbs NW of Boston and also tens of thousands of potential customers who work in the executive parks in town."

3235,dino001,June 2015,"I attended BMW's annual drive event (they do those every late spring in my area) at my dealership. I like those, as you get a car without a salesman. I drove 428i Gran Coupe and souped up 335ix with sport transmission and bunch of other options, all M-Sport related. 335 was fast, but I already knew that before, so it didn't overwhelm me with awesome power. The new LCI steering update is just in time, as even souped up 335 still had that soft feel.

The positive surprise was 428 GC. It was Luxury Line. I think they continue working on this engine and it probably improved since the introduction. I pushed it harder this time and it produced a decent low-pitch grunt that I didn't hear before. I also proved fairly quick. I was skeptical for long time, but I'm warming up a little to a possibility of giving up on the six-cylinder for the economy (both price and fuel). The steering in 428 was also a bit better than 335 (there are wider wheeltrack and same wheelbase, also reportedly slight suspension differences between 3- and 4-series). LCI could not have come fast enough, let's hope some of that steering feedback is restored. I anticipate even 4-series will benefit, too, hopefully they'll bring it sooner than full year from now.

I suspect that once the LCI dust settles it will be for me between 328 wagon and 428 or 435 Grand Coupe. There is also Gran Turismo, but it's too cow-ish so far. I have time to decide. Seems it works for my benefit - the deals will get better, as the model ages. The reliability should also go up.

I, for reasons that would take more explanation that worthwhile, hate Toyotas -- and, after today, I have to say, I really hate the Avalon even more than the Camry, if that is possible.

I'll, for me, net this out -- good is the enemy of great. Toyota's, especially the two noted above, are the epitome of good cars -- and that is what makes them so, er, hate-worthy.

I know these are really very popular cars -- the things are everywhere.

Isn't there any way to make great cars at every price point?

Really, really -- good is the enemy of great and, therefore, perhaps, good is evil as it makes us dumb down our expectations. While these cars may be incredibly reliable, they suck the joy out of driving and will be, in the end, the reason self-driving cars will be here in an alarmingly short time from now.

3240,dino001,June 2015,"I would not buy Toyota vehicle, although I noticed they improved their styling and interiors considerably. In its own right, Toyotas are actually great cars, they just emphasize things that are not important to you and ignore those that are. If you ever watched Top Gear episode on Hilux (Euro version of Tacoma), you'd absolutely say that Toyota makes great cars - for those who have particular expectations, vastly different from yours. To hate Toyota the way you describe it, is to hold all those people in contempt and declare your life priorities as the only ones worth considering, which I think is too far. Some people simply care about price, fuel economy and durability, cheap maintenance. Toyota absolutely excels in those. Those people buy their vehicles to keep them for 10 years, they'd rather spend the money somewhere else. Those are valid life choices, regardless how hard you find that to fathom. You may still hate them, but to say they don't make great cars is only an opinion, not fact.

Then I saw the Arrest me red 2015 Dodge Challenger, first time driving the LH cars with the new 8 spd transmission and updated interior. WOW.. What a fun car, even though it rained the entire time I was in Jersey the car was still fun. Nice thick leather steering wheel, If I was blind folded and felt the wheel, I would have sworn it was the M Sport Wheel from BMW, that is how nice it was. The transmission had a sport mode, which only seemed to change the shift pattern of the transmission to be more aggressive, the seats were very nice, comfortable and supportive.

Now Toyota is running ads proclaiming the ""Bold, New Camry"". Since doesn't look particularly new and has no outstanding performance characteristics I think they're making a mistake. These claims have little credibility

Interesting numbers that show the power of brand equity. BMW may have softer steering but their reputation will take decades to unravel even if they don't spiff up their latest 3-series.

Counter-counterpoint:

With a smile on my face and malice toward none, this seems somewhat of an apology on behalf of Toyota. My point and question is why not build a great car at every price point. I do think the Toyota is probably a good car -- and, as someone says (not just someone but Voltaire, born in 1694) -- ""good is the enemy of great.""

I would agree with something here -- ""95% of the buying public has no . . . need for an ELLPS."" Their interest level is harder to ascertain, but, assuming you are correct that 95% have no interest, I would be made both sad and fearful. I assume you assume they -- the 95% -- have no interest because . . .um, they have never been exposed to greatness (at THAT particular price point)?

Let me give you an irrelevant comparison -- while growing up, my mother fixed this nasty-tasting ""entree"" she called salmon patties. They looked like a cross between a hamburger and what, today, I think of as a mostly-crab, crab-cake. The taste, after frying was, well, horrible. But, hey, it's Friday so well it was either fried smelt or salmon patties; so after a while I actually ate the salmon patties entirely. I don't think I ever liked them, but I did learn to tolerate them. Eventually, in a sentimental, not logical or rational, moment I was told I actually said (I deny this) ""salmon patties are good."" Perhaps, salmon patties are good compared to, er, hmm, DIRT!

Time and tide, time and tide -- and I eat (in college) at a nice restaurant and the special of the day is salmon. First off, when it comes, I barely recognize it, and then when I taste it, I know for sure ""this sure as hell isn't salmon!"" Salmon is great, I love salmon -- I had grown to accept canned salmon [allegedly] as good.

How much is an Avalon or a Camry? Don't answer that, the point is not how much it costs it's that for THAT much money, it ought to be possible to build a great car, not just a good one that has a lot of stuff for the money. Now, if the stuff is what actually makes it great -- and NOT the driving experience or its capabilities -- well, then I don't know what we're all talking about here. We COULD add navigation and blu-tooth to a Trabant I would assume, but that wouldn't make it even a good car, it would still be a bad car that just happen to have sat-nav.

I don't think everyone needs or wants or should need or want an ELLPS -- I do think we all deserve to know what real salmon tastes like, so to speak. These super popular ['good' car] brands, Toyota being the one I chose to exemplify my point, are just one of the contributors the great dumbing-down we're ""enjoying"" these days."

Mainstream cars (in my case Hondas) are good enough for 95% of US drivers.  I have had fresh salmon - two Mercedes bought new - but Honda/Toyota/etc serve my purposes perfectly.  We each should buy what fills our needs, and no one should belittle those choices.  You were not doing that but I have seen others that do so.

It's a bit like somebody lamenting all those factory-made suits - if everybody just went to a tailor, world would be so much better place, wouldn't it (we wouldn't have to look at cheap suits)?

3271,markcincinnati,June 2015,"It is true, I hope for the stuff we humans produce to be great -- and I would hope everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy everything they experience and have at the highest level possible at a given price point.

What or where or when did I suggest that I would compare a Rolls to a Honda. My point has been to start a conversation regarding greatness at a given price point -- any price point. Somehow, however, it seems that we're actually now saying that ""good enough"" is, hmm, good enough.

Do we now tell our children, their teachers, our leaders, etc, that it is ""OK"" to not go for great?

How could it belittle anyone to urge them to strive for ""the best"" (at every price point) -- I've not suggested that the customer who shops for a Chevy is any less entitled to the best (at that price point) than is the Rolls buyer (at that price point).

Everything made and done is not great -- I assume we all would agree to that. I am hoping to spark the conversation to perhaps contemplate that we simply shouldn't settle for good enough no matter how much or little we pay.

I just think that good enough or good has begat an erosion of what we'll accept -- hence the term dumbing-down. We, at times, seem complacent -- we accept good enough, we don't ""demand"" great.

I find this whole discussion funny, I made a comment a week or so ago that, the people who buy Camry's and Accords do so because they like them and they think they are great cars.. So that is who defines them as being great. I like Mark, but the Camry is beneath he and his wife, he has every right not to call the Camry or Accord not great cars.

Some people look at cars are appliances, and those are the people who look at a 20K Camry and call them great, they don't care about handling or acceleration, they are looking for a comfortable car that starts every time they get into and doesn't cost a lot of money to maintain."

15K that is a starter kit for most Audiophiles.

When I was hunting for HTS for our current house, I was amazed on what people wanted to sell me, one place told me for the money, Mirage speakers was great, but didn't like how they sounded. I had a very high end business talk to me about Transmission Audio, I'd never heard them before, but once I figured the the guy was playing with me, I had a good laugh, Price for the speakers, well, if you have to ask you can't afford them, but was told a million for each speaker..

He's like how can Sony be lame? I just say receivers are not Sony's bread and butter unless you have an ES model.

I had him add a good old Energy 8"" sub woofer I sold him for $100 plus $15 for the cable, plus 1/2 of shipping. Then I had him add new 12 ga.

3289,markcincinnati,June 2015,"Today, to save some miles and money, I rented a car from Enterprise to drive from Cincinnati to Nashville.

I asked for a full-size car and was presented with a new gas powered Jetta -- I assume it would be considered the base car. I have only a rough idea of how much this car costs. I have been given Nissan cars, Toyota cars, Jeeps and on and on as rentals. This was my first Jetta rental.

Drove the thing at a steady 80MPH stopping south of Bowling Green for a bio break.

Car's computer says 39.6MPG.

Compared to most of the cars that pass as full size rental fleet offerings, this seems to be the great car I started on about when I was being critical of Toyotas. Now, it has no nav, no power seats, no heated seats and the sound system is strictly AM and FM -- and if it has blu-tooth, well, I can't figure out how to make it work. But the car is competent, no, no, VERY competent at the thing that a car must be competent at -- the driving experience. It is, at its price point, great.

I would assume a stroll through the option list could make this car much more expensive and, yes, it would be ""nicer"" -- but how could it be anything else, starting with a great base car like this.

This is the salmon I wish dear ol' mom would have introduced me to.

My personal vehicles or my personal willingness to dump $X into a car have nothing to do with great vs good -- this Jetta should be purchased by other car companies, disassembled and examined and within reason imitated.

If this car can be produced and marketed for what I assume would be considered a ""cheap"" MSRP by ELLPS mfgrs and customers, there ought to be no reason others -- including Toyota -- couldn't do it, too.

You don't need to equate great with big bucks.

You seem to have a hard time looking at things from a different perspective than your own.
I do like German cars -- but I also liked my Acura TL, often comparing it favorably to an S4. Assuming you're correct regarding the ""popularity"" of VW for the reasons you cite (and I am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. Since the cars' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, I can understand their waning sales. Yet, this Jetta is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative. Now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming I have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged.

VW should be ashamed of itself if the reliability and dealer experience isn't corrected sooner rather than later.

Speaking of perspectives, I also enjoyed our Infiniti -- kept it 39 months, and other than a new set of tires, the thing was as close to flawless (in terms of the driving experience, reliability and durability) as one would expect. I did test the Q50S, the Lexus 350 F-Sport (and even ordered one) -- so I can understand and support several non-German cars as great. My specific rant pertaining to Toyotas was just that, remarks pertaining to Toyota, not all non-German cars.

I do test drive a lot of cars, and I rent a lot of cars -- the rental experiences typically allow me to drive hundreds of miles in a given example. The Toyotas typically and specifically are a huge disappointment -- which confuses me considering their apparent sales successes. Hondas, to name another Asian brand, on the other hand, do not suffer from this good enough approach. The Hyundai Genesis, and Kia Optoma too are examples of cars that certain seem to not be satisfied with a good enough approach.

A few days ago when I started this ""I'm disappointed in"" Toyota thread, I did only mention Toyota and that still stands. The phrase, ""I hate Toyotas"" is simply my way, in this forum of supporting the notion that good is the enemy of great.

The good news is, it certainly seems that a lot of folks are participating and voicing their opinions on this and other subjects, which, from my perspective is a good thing, what this ""tool"" (the Edmunds forum) is all about."

Gotcha. I never thought of that. In your case I can understand. You were able to rent cars you were interested in on the cheap.

DRIVE IT LIKE YOU LIVE
This trip was a business trip -- a second demonstration of software my company sells to a large prospect. A very good revenue opportunity. I am one of the owners of the company and the CEO. The CTO of the company and I were going to make a two-hour presentation and move the needle toward ""buy."" When we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in. Chicago, drive. Cleveland, drive. New York, fly. Nashville @ 3:45, drive (and besides the cost of 2 round trip tickets was over $2K). We pay $.55 per mile for using ""your"" personal car. The rental plus gas for this trip was about $150, hotel another $240 (we stayed at the ""Maxwell House""). At over 600 miles total, there would have been a significant cost increase in using a personal vehicle.

What kind of example would it set if I used a personal car and charged the company @$.55 per mile x 600+ miles? The next trip to, er, Pittsburgh where I am not going would cost what?

So, driving it like I live is EXACTLY what I did.

Now, were I to return to Nashville for a pleasure trip (and Nashville is worthy of such a trip if you axed me), I would take either the S4 or the SQ5.

By the way, the return trip, at 85mph further solidified my opinion that even a bare bones Jetta really is in no danger of being called the enemy of great -- this car IS great.

While in Nasville, I saw and looked into a new Maxima -- in some kind of deep red-wine metallic color with sick wheels. Wow -- this is a looker, I'll give it that. And, afterwards I went on-line to ""build"" one -- they can be had fully decked out in sport trim for an MSRP under $40K. Actual prices, I would assume would be less. Of course, looks can be superficial -- but to repeat, this car has the looks.

In any case, given the circumstances, would you have said to your colleagues, ""the most expensive way to get to and from Nashville, by car, is the way we're gonna do it?""

Not if you drive it like you live, you wouldn't."

Good to hear the Maxima's pictures don't do the car justice, as they aren't flattering, at all. I just came from Nashville for a conference, myself. Nashville is one of those places that are a ""tweener"" for me. It's right between ""do I fly? do I drive?""

Given that the conference was being held in the Gaylord (where parking is $25/nt), 1 work day lost driving up and back, which is the real cost of driving. Cheap airfare ($350). I flew. Left at :6:30 a.m., arrived in time for a full dya's work, using the hotel's airport shuttle. That doesn't even count the gas, wear, etc.

Chicago is another one that's a tweener, especially if you're staying downtown, where parking can run $50/day.

BTW...was next door to your Audi dealer last night meeting some friends at a ""Grinder"" joint. I parked right behind two S4s, one blue, one white. They haven't changed at all since I had mine ('13).

Beer was indeed cold, and the Grinders were indeed good. Can't ask for much more than that. Sat outside looking at the Audis come and go.

Saw lots of cars come and go (Grinders parking lot must be a dealer ""turnaround point"") with dealer tags stuck haphazardly to their rears...mostly Chevies, Caddys, Audis and Mercedes. Dealers within a 3-4 mile radius of the Grinder place.

Observations...

-As big as the new Chevy Tahoe is, it's a looker.
-Escalade must be doing well. We saw 4 of them turnaround with dealer tags....big and lit up like Christmas
-saw one Mercedes CLS (very sharp), 2 CLAs, and one C Class that hooked like demos pulling in and out of the parking lot

Mark...asking you this question given how much you love Audi. Am I reading correctly that the new A4s are dropping HP and torque to go to a less powerful 4 cyl motor? That seems to fly in the face of everything the other ELLPS competitors are doing.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
3326,markcincinnati,June 2015,"I have been told by my rep at The Audi Connection that HP & Torque of ALL the [US] Audi power-plants will increase. We saw, already, the 2016 A6 3.0T adopt the S4 tuning (raised the A6 to 333 HP, just like my A4), and the S6/S7 cranked up the HP or Torque or both, too.

The little engine that could (the 2.0T) has had its power bumped from 200, to 211, to 220 and I believe will be again goosed to 240. Under the four-rings, the torque was always pretty strong at 258 at sub 2,000 RPMs.

And, without breaking a sweat, apparently, Audi really goosed the 4-cylinder to just south of 300HP for the S3, even though there is a lame-o 2.0T (at 200HP and 207lb/ft) in the Q3 (this, I am assured, is temporary, the Q3 will soon come with the beefier 2.0T).

My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque. Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. . . .

I would look over a couple year period for the performance envelope to be pushed (upward) by increases, across the lineup, of HP and Torque.

Now, of course, we will have engines other than gas and hybrids and so on -- my assumption is that if the diesel SQ5 were to be offered (in the US) even though it's HP would be down, its torque would be up and through tuning and transmission choices, the ""S"" - ness of the vehicle would not be compromised.

Probably wishful thinking on my part to imagine Audi of America would actually bring the SQ5 in diesel trim to the US.

Look for all of the Europeans, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and VW to name just a few, to continue the march upward in HP and Torque achieved using 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines and dropping or reducing the number of and application of V8s, V10s, V12s and W12s.

I have not heard anything about decreasing the power,

Of course, you could be thinking of the smaller displacement engines Audi (among others) offers in markets other than the US. There are smaller (than 2.0T) engines offered by Audi in some of its cars in Europe, for example -- both in gas and diesel configurations.

My answer assumes you were talking about US bound Audi engine offerings."

Both of us wanted to love our Japanese vehicles. There was really nothing wrong with either one of them, but they could not hold us since they lacked that je ne sais quoi that even a stripped Jetta is imbued with.

You can -- and some folks here do -- remark on either the reliability or durability or both sometimes associated with owning a German car. Our experience with German cars has been very positive overall. Yet, we know about the rumors swirling around about the eventual breathtakingly expensive maintenance and repairs that we surely will face if we keep our Germans beyond, 60,000, 70,000 or even more miles.

I can't argue that these dire consequences don't await us, for the highest mileage we've ever kept a German car has been 66K miles -- and that Audi felt ""new"" to me the day I traded it in (on another Audi).

The European cars, most notably the German ones are, somehow, addictive to drive. I would suspect the Japanese cars still haven't cracked the code of how to be a driver's car -- no matter how highly contented or carefree they may ultimately be.

For instance: The Golf R or GTI seem to be quite the bargains, and the car magazines do shower them with many positive comments and pounds of prose extolling their driving virtues. It seems to be that the same is said less often about cars from the other continents.

I do understand, support and agree with everyone's right to choose to drive what Automobile or Car & Driver, et al, magazine would call 'boring cars,' but I do wonder if those who decry my critical comments about said 'boring cars' have actually spent much time behind the wheel of one of the German cars (from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Porsche) so often fawned over by enthusiast magazine journalists? If I have misread this, I apologize without further ado.

You may love your fill-in-the-blank and think my [admittedly] biased perspectives elitist or even ignorant, and that is fine with me -- I leave this post, however, once again urging you to test drive, test drive, test drive and keep test driving as many cars as possible. Makes the weekends very interesting, that much is certain.

A friend of mine always ends up buying/leasing KIA's and/or Mazda's all the while waxing darn near poetic on the virtues of Audis, BMWs, Mercedes, Porsches and even a few of VW's offerings. He always wants to ""test"" my cars -- and then ultimately goes for the KIA Optima or the Mazda 3 or 6 citing that he is ""too frugal"" to go for the ""superior sports sedan""-- electing to go for the Optima which he says is better than they used to be in the suspension department and since they poached the car's designer from Audi AG, well, ""the KIA Optima is great looking too.""

I can't find fault with him for wanting to be frugal -- I really don't find fault at all with his designation of what to spend his money on, of course. I do find myself confused -- I would think he (or anyone who seems to say one thing and do another) must suffer from chronic cognitive dissonance, however.

Don't do it.

1. You LOVE that S4. You are going to despise every mile you put on that '07 Civic while your S4 sits at home in your garage. Cars are meant to be driven.

2. While your S4 will depreciate more so than a similar car with less miles, it won't be worth $25,000 less. What are you going to do, lease or buy your wife a Civic, Accord, or CRV?

3. The extra mileage the Civic gets will not offset the cost of acquiring another vehicle?

Now, if you want to talk about a car that performs at or above the level of an S4 (which you will appreciate given the fact that you do track your car) and doesn't depreciate nearly as much, get yourself a WRX STi;)

Perhaps in addition to being confused by my friend's decision to go with the thing he thinks is inferior to the BMW (or whatever) he really wants, I am made somewhat sad that he -- a very close friend -- seems to have such passion for something that is not the thing he will go ahead and spend on.

There is always somewhat of a tone, a lament, as he apparently rationalizes not going for the ""thing"" about which he waxes oh so poetic and is also very knowledgeable about. He cites chapter and verse the performance stats and specifications of this, that and the other Porsche or BMW, etc, then apologizes for the KIA. This is a very successful and well educated guy. Perhaps it is that this behavior seems out of character.

He has no need to apologize -- to me at least -- for his decision. Our friendship is not based upon his possessions -- and there is no way he could think that the case. Had I the means and a spouse who would permit, I'd get him an M3 or 5 series for pity's sake and hopefully enjoy -- vicariously -- him drive it.

I guess a perspective could be that we all settle -- but I don't think that is the planet you are referring to. I do believe most people, most of the time, seek out and acquire the best ""things"" they can.

If we all hyper-extended ourselves, we all could -- for a time -- live well beyond our means. I believe most of us with decent incomes and relatively to very good credit scores could ""score"" a $100,000 car. I assume, considering that most of us here are discussing cars that have a median or even mean cost of $50,000+/-, we could ""get a $100K car done."" By that standard, I would have to concede I have settled. I don't live or think that way -- in the particular case of the car, every mile I drive in my car has, so far, been better than the last. I'm driving what I want to drive (not that I don't also have interest in something better).

Actually, it was the emotional impact of my friend, rather than touting the virtues of his new Optima, chose lamenting that it wasn't a BMW (5 series, as I recall). That's what got to me.

Every mile a smile, as my wife says. If someone willfully, knowingly and deliberately starts down a path that they think will be every mile a ""frown"", well that too would be some other planet than the one I've lived on for some six decades."

If you bought the S4 to hold it's value you made a big mistake. I have 30K on my 320i and it's not even 2 yrs old, if you are worrying about mileage on your car, then next time purchase a Dodge Dart. Since your S4 has been in an accident, the value has has been depreciated already."

Why not just swap cars with the wife?
Well, I'd have to trust the wife with the pricey S4, and she doesn't have a long commute, but she still works 5 days per week so it would still be gaining miles. She's a good driver but I wouldn't trust her 100% with the S4 until she completes a HPDE weekend (which so far I've been unsuccessful in getting her to try). Even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the S4 by being just horrible.

I'm not sure the WRX STI would depreciate slower than the S4; especially considering the S4 now has 25,000 miles whereas I'm assuming you meant get a brand new WRX STI. The first 25,000 miles are the biggest.

If I could live with a stick for a daily driver on congested freeways, The STI would be right up my alley. Since I don't want a stick for daily duty, Subaru is out until they develop a good dual clutch auto-manual transmission. At least they don't' embarrass the STi with a CVT option. The Golf R would be a good alternative...., but even if the S4's extra weight keeps it from handling as well, the tuning options on the S4 are quite extraordinary. You can basically turn it into an AWD muscle car that handles reasonably great considering its weight.

The other consideration is the wife is starting to itch for a new vehicle after 8 years with the Civic. Something roomier would be nice since we have a 19-1/2 month old now, and possible wishes for a 2nd in the near future. The Golf SportWagon just surpassed the Forester in the running... TDI; great mileage, and right now diesel is cheap. It is ""JUUUUUSSSST"" big enough with the significantly elongated rear end, and I'm not sure any vehicle is as space efficient as the new Golfs/GTI's.

The S4 has performed exemplary as the Sport Sedan disguised as a Family Sedan thus far. 2 kids is pushing it though; but maybe not until at least one of them is much older. The worst thing is being told you should go rear-facing with the car seat up to 2 years. Rear-facing takes up MUCH MORE room than front-facing, and I think the statistics that say it's 5X safer are skewed by really bad drivers.

I agree, I'm an Audi buyer and I wouldn't touch one that has been in a moderate to major accident with a ten foot pole. Not without a big steep discount. Luckily I can just keep mine long term as it turns out it has been extremely reliable not only before the accident, but after (less one coolant hose debacle). The problem is (and the big difference is) you have some control over your miles (move your residence or buy an extra car), but you have no control over an accident that is in the history books, nor future accidents (not at fault) for that matter.

Appreciate the input you and others here have given. I guess life is too short to drive a 140 HP Civic EX Sedan 65+ miles a day over a 333 HP (underrated stock number) S4 Sedan. Of course, I don't have much fun doing the typical route on the freeway being stuck behind mind numbing traffic. However, as I've previously mentioned; I've found a very fun route home that doesn't cost much extra time but most definitely costs me extra fuel, brakes and tires. I'll trade the fun for brakes, gas, and tires though; it's worth it.

Well, I'm underwhelmed by some of the cars out these days. While I could afford a quite expensive car it is not in my current desire to spend more than perhaps $35K or so. My preferences are mildly sporty but nicely appointed smaller cars. So I'm thinking either a fully loaded Mazda 3 which handles really well and can have a pretty nice interior; or perhaps a used C-class. I don't find the Bimmers nice enough inside for my tastes. I'm ok with the current A4 but frankly don't want to spend that much - I found my '98 A4 at least as appealing as the current model. And I really lament the scarcity of manual transmissions and that is probably one reason that I'm not overly motivated by a lot of the available choices. I might consider something like a VW GTI but I'm not inclined to deal with VW and their parts and service again. I find the current Jetta a bore-fest.

Part of the reason I've kept the TL so long is that it is really reliable and I've not found anything that moves me a whole lot at a decent price point. So I keep driving the TL while waiting for something more interesting to come along."

I don't know about that ... didn't that iteration of the TL have 225 HP? The Mazda, in ""s"" trim, has 185 HP. And, the power to weight ratio might be pretty similar.

Yeah, you're giving up the smoothness of the 6 for the potential buzziness of the 4, but the better mileage may make up for that.

One thing I forgot to mention is that I also looked at the A3 - while I do like my cars a bit smaller (I find my TL borderline too big), the A3 was just too tight for me to like and seemed a bit too cheap inside.

Regarding the Mazda, we do have an '07 Mazda 5 and I find the 4 cyl quite refined for a 4. Of course it is not a hot rod but it has a tighter turning circle, better steering feel, and is way more agile than my TL, which is probably why I would consider the Mazda 3. A fully loaded 3 is almost like a baby Bimmer and fully loaded seems to be just as nice from an interior POV, an area where to me the 3-series has always fallen a bit short."

Think all the Big 3 stereotypical owner experiences everyone always harps on the Big 3 about and many think is history but for some it is still current events and news. Breaking news. Is it 2015 or 1995? His CTS is outgunning my Neon right now for Lemon of the Century. At least my Neon didn't become a complete lemon until after year 3 was over by 1 day. Even worse when I hit 36,000 miles probably just before year 4. That being said, it did need to be towed the first morning after it's first night in the garage at home. For balance, Dodge never told me they couldn't fix it.

How's the mileage with the TDI? Strongly considering a Golf SportWagen TDI for the wife. It is winning out over the Forester, even the Forester XT with leather.

Regarding another post about Mazda's and Audi's, I too, find the new A3 interior to be a bit of a let down, but only as compared to what is expected of Audi interiors. I think the '06+ A3 interior was superior. Of course, a GTI today can cost more than my A3 did in 2006, so inflation is a factor. I would say the A3 still has a better interior than any Mazda, but of course you pay for it. Nothing against Mazda, and not trying to bash them, but this is my impression from the last Mazda 3 rental I had a few years back:

1) All-around good economy car.
2) Coming from then being a current A3 owner, it felt like it had really thin sheet metal. Experience felt like I was driving a tin can car down the road as compared to the A3 being a bank vault or tank. Tin can is a bit harsh, probably more appropriate to use that term on the late 90's Kia Sephia rental I had. But there is a noticeable difference.

Perhaps when I mentioned cheap inside, I'm also subconsciously adding ""...for the price"". I could get a stripper A3 for the low $30's, or a max loaded Mazda 3 for the high $20's - and the 3 has more equipment by far at those respective prices, as well as (I think) a bit more space inside but still a small package. I might also consider a manual on the Mazda 3 if I could get one fully loaded - something not available any more on the Audis.

I think I favor a bit more of the luxury side compared to some of those on this board since obviously if I wanted pure speed/handling I could go BMW. To get decent luxury in a BMW you pretty much need to add $10K for all the options and even then IMHO the Audis are nicer. But the prices on the Audis have gone somewhat stratospheric since I bought my '98 A4 brand new. At that time the Audi was pretty loaded for the same price as a low end 3-series that was a lot more stripped. Nowadays Audi (to their credit) is seen much more positively than they were in the late '90s."

The S4 is available with a 6-speed manual transmission complete with all 3 pedals on the floor! It also amazingly makes the car quite cheap, at under $50K even with extra pricey paint before negotiation. If you have to have all the gadgets and doodads then add $8K.

I agree with your assessment. In fact, I think the TL from 10 years ago is superior in some ways to the new TLX. Although, to be fair, the TLX is available with a V6 too, though they seem to be rare and overpriced.

10 years ago I was able to get a sport packaged equipped Audi A3 for about $30K out the door, nowadays, that wouldn't get me a loaded GTI.

Seems to me you might want to try the Golf R, reviews seem to say it is nice, refined, and should give that tight agile feel your looking for at under $40K, if you can find one. I didn't like the A3 for it's too small trunk, too plain interior, but I did like how light and toss-able the chassis felt.

One thing you've probably already thought of is that few brands beyond Acura are likely to give you the 10 or so years of very reliable service that you've had with your TL. If you'd gotten a MB, Audi, or BMW back in 2005, by now it's likely you would have run into some expensive stuff. And I'm not sure it's fair to compare the price of your TL ten years ago with the price of a TLX today. A loaded Audi A3 might suit you better, but it will costs c. $5000 or so more than a comparable TLX.

The TLX really does have some significant features beyond your TL. It's much safer, gets higher mpg, has 4 wheel steering, as well as a lot of other things just being dreamed of ten years ago.

I liked the handling of our Mazda5 too, but it failed the IIHS crash test. Since the Mazda5 essentially killed the dummy inside, we sold it.

Did you like the ILX?

Ok- you went from a RWD inline six to FWD 4CYCL-and you are pleased- explain.
I am not trying to be harsh here I just need to hear your pleasantry regarding this change.
I always try to go a step up on the food chain in regards to car- new or used- not boasting, just a goal I set.
Currently 535XI- next, probably a 550XI (new) or a 650 (used).
Well, I don't know how much you want me to go into it.

I'm beyond the ""stepping up the food chain"" with my car purchases, and appreciate what different cars have to offer. On top of that, I change out of cars often enough that I'm only committed to a particular purchase as long as I am enjoying it, thus giving me the ""freedom"" to try different cars out.

When I say I am pleased with the change, it has nothing to do with directly comparing the BMW and the Mazda3 - perhaps that was misleading. For what type of car I was looking for, the Mazda really fit the bill well.

I was sort of in a large sedan mode with the 535i (xdrive), having also just come out of a Passat. But with a nice comfortable minivan as the family hauler, I had the freedom and yearning to return to something more on the compact, sportier side for my daily driver. I also was interested in a manual transmission. Such cars are becoming more and more scarce, and the Mazda 3 is a nice choice for those priorities (I also considered a WRX and Civic Si, but liked the overall balance of the Mazda. And my wife already has a GTI, or I probably would have gone that route). The Mazda is very engaging to drive, requiring driver involvement to best take advantage of its (relatively low by today's standards) 184 hp through the slick 6-speed manual.

I most frequently post on the CCBA forum, and those that participate there know me (and my habits) fairly well. Lest my current ride be taken as speaking out of place on this particular forum, I have indeed owned several ELLPS vehicles, mostly various 3-series. I've also owned three 5-series, one of each from the past three models (E39, E60 and F10). The F10, while superbly comfortable and sharp-looking, just didn't hit the same notes as my earlier BMWs - that wasn't surprising based on test drives; I knew full well what I was getting into. I just didn't realize how much I'd be longing for the increased driver involvement.

So, I went for the total contrast in the Mazda 3. Within a year or two, I suspect I'll land somewhere in the middle, having my eye on a 4-series GC once they start hitting the used market.

The S4 is available with a 6-speed manual transmission complete with all 3 pedals on the floor! It also amazingly makes the car quite cheap, at under $50K even with extra pricey paint before negotiation. If you have to have all the gadgets and doodads then add $8K.
Andres, thanks for the suggestion. I don't think I'm inclined to spend that much for the S4 although I'm sure I would enjoy it. Also isn't the A4 due for a redesign in a year or so? I'm curious to see what changes. Unfortunately I'm sure it will go up in price some more."

@tlong - if you get serious about going with the Mazda3, I'd be happy to provide you with my experience.

I recently went from my 535i to a Mazda3 S with a manual trannie, for much of the same reasons you are citing regarding your TL.

I've been pleased with the change thus far.
Breld, thanks for the suggestion and I would be interested in your thoughts. Feel free to PM me if you don't want to post a lengthy story.

I'm sure after 10 years with my TL I would find some things lacking in a smaller car like the Mazda (I suspect noisier, tinnier, etc.). Of course my TL is tinnier than my A4 was. But boy it is nice to have high reliability and reasonable parts cost. I suppose we are all looking for that German feel with the reliability of the Asian makes. I'm sure for those who lease or keep a vehicle a short time it's not so important, but I'm a minimum 100K miles type of guy and so reliability is kind of important."

I sort of liked the ILX. It was nice and all but actually the car I really used to like was the original TSX, before they bloated it up. I had those as loaners a few times and liked the interior, size, and agility. The ILX is nice but the styling inside and out isn't motivating me. I'm sure they are good reliable cars which would be the plus, but I'm thinking not very sporty. Honda/Acura seems to have lost that sportiness that they had in the 80s and 90s."

I've been up the ladder to the '98 A4, bought new, sport package, 6 cyl 5 speed. I STILL miss that car - but out of warranty at like 60K I started having cooling issues and the dealer of course could not figure it out, to the tune of a few trips of $800-$1200 each. Intermittent on warm days, only when the car was under load like climbing hills, etc. So I got rid of it at 88K, which is the earliest I've ever gotten rid of a car.

I've also been up the ladder on the TL - 150K, very reliable, pretty luxurious, but kind of too big and a bit of a wallowy barge.

""The ladder"" of course is many things to many people - it could be cost, acceleration, badge, handling, economy, reliability, any combination of those. Thank goodness we have so many choices. I wouldn't disparage anybody's choices or priorities and so I can completely understand why those who owned BMWs would want something less expensive, or frankly, more involving. In the old days BMW was the high end ""involving"" make and Honda was probably the low end ""involving"" make. Nowadays I'm not so sure it's BMW at the high end and it is certainly not Honda at the lower end any more. Which is why Mazda is appealing if you are trying to be economical but still get some involvement."

I was initially looking at a GTI back in 2007, but the local VW dealers all proved to be hopelessly inept. I checked out everything from a Mustang Bullitt to an X5 4.8is to an E39 M5. I finally decided to go with a FWD car since we were seeing so many Civic Sis, GTIs, Minis, etc.at our HPDEs- I figured I should have some actual seat time in that drivetrain configuration if I was going to instruct those drivers. The Mazdaspeed 3had received extremely good reviews from Automobile, AW, CD and R&T and was reasonably quick so I figured, why not?
Funny thing: at my first BMW CCA HPDE with the Mazdaspeed(dead stock, OEM tires) it was raining a bit during the first instructor session. I lapped every car on the track.

tlong....one thing you might want to do is drive the TLX. If refinement is at the top of your list, you might be pleasantly surprised by a test drive....especially the V6 SH AWD version.
The V6 SH AWD ""version"" is, if you axe me, not a version at all, it is an entirely different car. Whatever additional tuning is performed on the SH AWD ""version"" gives it transformed handling (reminds me of an S4) -- and it is not (or perhaps I should say it can't possibly be just because of) the torque vectoring rear differential.

Perhaps, in response to someone's question regarding why the Q50 isn't setting any sales records, I suggest driving back-to-back-to back the following: Acura TLX SH-AWD Advance, Infiniti Q50S AWD and the Lexus IS 350 F-sport AWD. Of the three, the Infiniti Q50S is the least impressive.

I used to say the BMW 3 was the German version of Infiniti's G37X -- somehow,they (Infiniti) lost their mojo with the new Q50S -- having said that, however, I have confidence they will find it again.

I liked the Lexus so much I ordered one, fully loaded, thinking even a Premium Plus S4 wasn't ""within reach"" -- but the magic discount offered due to my membership in the Audi Club of NA, plus some very impressive money factors, made the S4, as they say, within reach of us mere mortals."
3404,graphicguy,June 2015,"Mark...I concur with you. SH AWD, even in the TLX, is a ""horse of a different color"". While not the performance beast the S4 is, it's not far off the mark in many repsects.

I vascilate on the IS 350 F Sport. On the one hand, it's a fun drive. Not a ""bahn burner"" by any stretch, but peppy, with divine steering. Love the seats, too.

On the other hand, it's cramped. Certain features are just confounding. Overall, for high $40s all oaded up (and low-mid $40s discounted), you could do a lot worse. That puts it in the price ballpark of the TLX SH AWD ADVANCE. That's a tougher decision when you factor that into everything.

That C CLass and the interrior, and the ""smoothness"" of how it drives and operates, while giving up little in the way of ultimate performance can be had in the mid $40s range, too (loaded up and discounted).

Now, all of a sudden, I ask myself ""is a 335i worth $10K more?"" No immediate answer comes to mind because I'd have to ponder that one long and hard.

No disrrespect meant for those who like the Q50. But, my opinion only, it gets left by the side of the road amongst these others mentioned above. Even the Q50S feels crude by comparison.
2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring"
3405,markcincinnati,June 2015,"One of the things about the Q50 that I noticed -- having come from an FX with the same motor -- is a certain, er, ""coarseness"" (the pros call it thrashing) that the other Japanese and Germans lack. Now, having said that, the 3.7L motor in the Q50 seems to have been given a extra shot of sound deadening, but at full-cry the engine, which is still good, just shows its more unrefined side.

The Lexus, especially compared with the Acura, was a bit cramped inside; but after having had a TL, everything seems a bit tighter, and I would quickly forget the relative girth of the Acura. Yet, the Lexus had a nicer interior than the BMW 3 -- of that I am certain.

I am finding out that I am not a fan of the north and south display screens (e.g., in the Q50 and Acura), it makes the interior look a bit chopped up.

To each his/her own on that count, though. I hate the pop up nav screen that is all the rage these days -- looks so much like something from the aftermarket (Pioneer in-dash head units come to mind)."

They are torquey and it's amazing to me how they've almost removed any turbo lag. But, some are a little coarse. BMW falls into that category (as does the one in the CTS).

Looking at the 335i xDrive equipped the way I want puts me well into the low-mid $50s. The ""5"" in that number is a place I don't want to be.

Mercedes 2.0L turbo is smooth, as is the one in the Audi A4.

Still not as silky as say the 6 in the S4, IS 350 or TLX SH AWD, though. Ideally, Acura would slap a urbo on their 3.5L V6. For some reason, except for the previous RDX, Acura has shied away from turbos.

Thursday night, passed by the local Acura dealer. They looked dead. Hooked up with my favorite sales person to get an extended test drive of a TLX SH AWD Advance. You can immediately tell they shaved weight from the previous TL for that car. Much more refined, too....especially the suspension. Handles well. Great leather sports seats, as always. Tight as a drum...even the door slam sounds expensive. Pushbutton trans would trake some getting used to. Stereo, as always was ""killer"". Not sure what to think of the dual screen layout. Again, seems like the answer to a question no one asked. Relatively quick....thinking mid-high 5 sec range in the 60 romp according to my buttometer...about the same as my previous TL.

Sticker said 46K. Haven't looked at pricing since I'm not in the market. I dunno...thinking it would land somewhere in the low $40s. Very nice car for that kind of money. Performs well.

There is no 335d for F30 model in the US market. It was only E90 and IMHO that model was completely pointless (want a fast car, get 335).

I think C&D staff has unreasonable expectations, similar to those who buy a small coupe and then complain about rear seat being cramped, or getting a truck and then acting all surprised it doesn't handle like a sports car. It's a four-cylinder diesel that gets you 40 mpg. Nothing is free in this world. I drove 328 diesel, it was fine, exactly what you may want if you are a diesel buyer (I am not, but I think I can understand what people want when shop for one - it's not what 335d used to be).

The badge of course was a bit slight of hand - it's a Euro's 320d model rebadged for here as 328d. The reason is clear, as US buyers wouldn't pay upper market price (couple thousand premium over 328i) for a car with downmarket model designation (320). Badges matter here. It's also simple pricing difference overall (there same models being twice the price here, the differences between model designations do not translate into as significant pricing separation, in relative terms).

I'd like to see some statistics on that transfer case. If it's a real pattern, it's a big issue.

It's a four-cylinder diesel that gets you 40 mpg. Nothing is free in this world. I drove 328 diesel, it was fine, exactly what you may want if you are a diesel buyer (I am not, but I think I can understand what people want when shop for one - it's not what 335d used to be).

The badge of course was a bit slight of hand - it's a Euro's 320d model rebadged for here as 328d. The reason is clear, as US buyers wouldn't pay upper market price (couple thousand premium over 328i) for a car with downmarket model designation (320). Badges matter here. It's also simple pricing difference overall (there same models being twice the price here, the differences between model designations do not translate into as significant pricing separation, in relative terms).

I'd like to see some statistics on that transfer case. If it's a real pattern, it's a big issue.
Is that the case? I went to the UK site to see and they offer in the diesel 316, 318, 320, 325, 330, 335. No where could I find the actual engine size. Does BMW actually make 6 different diesels in those sizes?

I used the live chat at bmw.uk.co and their reply was the 316, 318, 320 all use the 2.0 engine and the 330, 335 use the 3.0. They are doing the same ""label = how it should perform"" as in the US."

To confirm it, you need to look up the UK specs of their 320d and see that the torque and hp numbers are exact match for 328d US version (I did it for German version).

Yes, the labeling has totally departed the engine size about 10 years ago, or so - even before then it was only loosely related (like 323/325 and 328/330 had same engine size, 3.0 liter). However, 328d is simply 320d from UK/Europe for marketing/pricing reasons. If you look at performance figures of 328d (US), they are significantly lower than 328i, more in line with 320i, which would fit as again, it really is 320d, rebadged.

The 335d was a test car for BMW, it was infact their first diesel car in the use in over 30 yrs, E38 524td, was a good car for the time, but was pricey. So fast forward to the E90 335d, was a rocket, 255hp and 413lbs of torque, it's basically the same engine in the 535d and X5 3.5d. The 3.5 liter was too big of engine for the E90, and I think the 2 liter is too small for the F30, BMW has a 2.5 liter 4 cyl oil burner which would give about 20 more HP and about 50 lbs more torque. It would still deliver in the high 40s on the open road. That would take care of the power problem."

That's right. However, there is a real difference between 320i and 328i in output, regardless of the engine size. Moreover, 320i/328i sold here are the same cars sold Europe with only differences due to market certification. However, US-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick. Europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy. Americans don't fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end (320d) would not sell at price that's even higher than mid-level 328i. Hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world.

BTW, the European love of diesels is clearly weakening. Not that it's gone, but they are not seen as attractive as they used to be. Price of fuel went up so much vs. gasoline (unlike in the US, Europe had had cheaper diesel for decades prior last few years - that was due heavier taxation of gasoline, but now it got offset by higher market pricing due to heavy machinery and generator demand plus more stringent refining requirements), so higher diesel price was offset by better mileage PLUS cheaper fuel. Today, the latter is gone, only mileage is better, so it takes much longer to offset purchase price premium. Diesels are still kings in larger vehicles, like SUVs and crossovers (which are coincidentally getting more popular there), but in smaller and midsize sedans/hatchbacks are getting less and less attractive in diesel versions and the proportions of new car sales are slowly changing.

3428,markcincinnati,June 2015,"New Shoes

The '14 S4 I ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires. The tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in Cincinnati -- the home of typically ""moderate"" winters -- I know I can't get away with ""summer only"" shoes year 'round. My previous A4 with the sport option came with 19"" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the Max Performance Summer Only tires that Audi chose was, optimistically not much north of 11,000 miles. This time, I thought I'd go with an S4 with the A/S's -- and I assumed since I was ordering an ""S"" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best UHP A/S's on the market, probably Continentals or Michelins.

Bzzz! Thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were ""H"" rated Grand Touring tires, albeit from Continental. The main characteristic of these GT tires was that they were very quiet. Otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an S4 -- the phrase ""under-tired"" springs to mind.

We had, prior to driving my wife's SQ5 off the lot had Continental DWS UHP tires put on the 20"" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were UHP A/S's) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.

So, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the SQ and me with 30,000+ miles on the S4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective S cars.

Meantime, back in the lab, Continental had updated the DWS tires and renamed them, slightly, DWS 06. Now, I have about 75+ miles on my new DWS 06 tires and the SQ gets its new shoes day after tomorrow.

For a 100% back-to-back commentary, we'll have to wait until we can drive in on DWS's and drive out on DWS 06's -- but my impressions of these tires on the S4 are from the context of driving in on Grand Touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on UHP very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that I've passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).

The DWS 06's if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the S4 from very good to ""I can't believe this is even the same car"" great. Additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing GT's and even the ""jolts"" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flubber perhaps?)

Here's the [current] bottom line:

These tires were designed to end ""your"" (and my) need to apologize for having all-season tires; there is quite a bit of explanation and detail that goes into what Continental did (or at least how their marketing department explains what they did) -- the sum and substance you can look up, but it all falls under the name ""Sport Plus"" technology.

SPT aims to provide drivers with much more precise handling (than any other UHP A/S tire on the market) and confidence and security on wet and/or slick surfaces, 35% stiffer sidewalls, and an even quieter ride than the DWS all with a 50,000 mile tread life warranty.

I'd say, thus far, their aim is true. These tires make me REALLY REALLY want to carve up the secondary roads I'm used to in my neck of the woods.

A set of four, for my S4 was $719.56 and was $908.96 for the SQ5 (S4: 245 x 40 x 18""; SQ5: 255 x 45 x 20"").

I had mine mounted and road-force balanced (plus a 4-wheel alignment) for $200, at the Audi dealer.

I plan to ""drive it like I live"" for at least another 40 - 45,000 miles.

Now I do oh-so-sincerely wish I had remembered to order the Sport Differential.

DOH!"

(whispering) Pure Joy. I can only imagine since I don't have the SD, but my wife and I took out an S5 w/SD recently -- it too had the 19"" wheel/tire package -- and it gave new meaning to the phrase ""corners like a snake in a rat hole.""

Since it would be financially crazy to do so, I will NOT be trading the current S4 for an S4 w/SD, but still, these DWS 06 UHP's have totally changed how fast I can enter a curve. It does carve like it's on rails!

In case anyone needs or wants to know: Front inflation [cold], 42 lbs, Rear, 40 lbs. The reason to do this -- especially on Audis -- is that they are nose heavy and when readying for a sharp turn maneuver the load shifts to the front, so I give the fronts a bit more [air pressure] to work with, figuring they need it."

3438,markcincinnati,July 2015,"Product Life Cycles: It's Time for a Change

The Germans -- and for all I know all of them -- produce new cars, not ""refreshes"", about once every eight years. My 2014 S4 is so very similar to my 2009 A4 (that I bought in third quarter 2008), it was difficult for me to actually see much difference, even though mine is a ""post refresh"" version.

Here is what this means: an A4 (and you can fill in the blank for your favorite make) available in calendar 2008 (in the US) is essentially repeated with continuous improvements in 2009, 2010, 2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015, with a truly new car unavailable until calendar 2016.

Now, don't get me wrong, my 2014 S4 does have many seen and certainly many more unseen improvements over my 2009 A4. But progress, like time and tide, continues to advance -- and apparently the ""avionics"" are seldom unable to be upgraded, which leaves the last two and sometimes three years of a ""model run"" possibly out-dated.

It's no wonder the A4's sales (see post above) have dropped nearly 15% (and there have been decent incentives on this model, and it still manages to have a sharp sales drop off). The phrase often seen in the enthusiast's magazines is ""long in the tooth"" -- and that term is typically used after about 6 years after an all-new model is released.

Now, I'm not simply or just talking about the styling changes that typically go along with an all-new model, no, I'm talking about the wheelbase, width, platform, engine/transmission choices and technology advances, the features and functions (available inside the car) and even the audio systems and safety features.

Yet Audi, BMW and Mercedes seem hell-bent on this 8-year cycle as if they haven't yet noticed the last couple of years of a model's cycle see a big time sales decline. There is some historical justification for delaying the new model roll-out, and there is, no doubt, an economic reason for doing this -- at least there used to be.

Now, new technology -- which makes its way to cars faster and faster and more quickly than ever before -- becomes available about every 18-24 months, which should translate to cutting the 8-year cycle to 6 years, and, frankly, perhaps to 5 years.

Conversely, the rapidity of available [technology] change could argue for the automotive manufacturers to take a page out of aviation's play-book -- that is to allow us at least some reasonable ability to upgrade our car's ""electronic"" systems. Increasingly, our cars interface with ""us"" via software controlled devices. Furthermore, even when the new software requires upgraded hardware components, we should be able to swap out the old for the new.

I recently upgraded my relatively old laptop by swapping out a spinning disk-drive for a solid state drive and simultaneously was able to move from Windows 7 to Windows 8 -- and you don't need to get me started on the ability to keep upgrading the OS on my Apple devices; and upgrade my home theater from VHS to DVD to BluRay without having to buy an entirely new home theater system.

Airplane owners have long enjoyed the ability to, as I said, upgrade the avionics of their planes to conform to FAA requirements or to add additional functionality to their planes.

I understand the need to produce newly styled vehicles -- but I believe the life cycles have to drop from 8 to 6 to 4 or 5 years, especially if auto manufacturers remain unwilling to allow us to make some in-between model upgrades. Folks who want the newest styling will always want the newest styling would be my assumption.

Imagine if the new iPhone didn't come out for five years after the last one, or if we had to wait for UHD-TV because HD hadn't been out for at least 8-years, and so on.

Audi, BMW, Mercedes and all the manufacturers who have these impossibly long lag times between the introduction of new models need to get with the realities associated with the Law, Moore's Law, that is."

I have to disagree. The new A3 left me feeling it wasn't a ""no corner cut"" Audi. I liked the lightweight chassis and tossable feel of the handling though. The old A3 was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the DSG transmission which had great tuning in '06 (maybe not the tuning a Toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for). Also, it was a sport package equipped A3 I had (sport leather seats, aluminum air vent rings, aluminum shift paddles, 10 mm lower ride height, stiffer springs, stiffer dampers; fog lights, spoiler on the roof, awesomely tuned for sporty driving).

It had little details with seemingly (at the time) no corners cut. Things like aluminum sills front and back, a power port in the cargo area, lighting for all areas of the interior, and the DSG learned ""your style of driving."" By the way I don't own the A3 because I sold it at about 8 years old with 106,000 miles on the odometer ($8K).

The new A3 is smoother, quieter, but not as raw and involving. The transmission is tuned to pretend to be a regular run of the mill automatic unless you put it in S. It would be interesting to look at them side by side at the same time for comparison.

3442,markcincinnati,July 2015,"Jurassic Audi?

I am happy that Audi brought the A3 to market -- my assumption is this model will bring more customers into the fold. Everytime I visit my dealership, I make certain I get in whatever A3's are on the showroom floor. I must say, I think a base A3 without any options, seems out of place next to the RS7, S8, A6 TDI, and Q5's (and sometimes even an RS8) on the showroom floor, however. The higher contented (with sexier wheels) A3's just like the high zoot Q3's have no problem being a member of the family, however.

I have twice driven an S3, and I found them to be quick, powerful, almost visceral -- raw and rough around the edges. For $50K, plus $11 for the ear plugs that would be required, however, I would never buy one. Furthermore, firm is one thing, but the S3 in dynamic mode is harsh, more unrefined than any Audi I've ever driven -- until you get the thing above 90MPH, then it starts to make sense.

But, $50,000+ for an S3 -- which may not be too much considering the content and performance -- seems to put it out of the ""boy racer"" league, unless the ""boy"" has Trump as his last name.

The current S4 is showing its age, to be sure, but even though there is a new S4 looming in a matter of months, the current S4, for somewhat similar money, still seems far more refined and its supercharged V6 is sublime compared to the S3's sturm und drang.

The S3, to an older fart like me, reminds me of the first time my then boss let me drive his new Porsche 944 turbo. When I found out how much it cost, I just couldn't fathom why anyone would subject themselves to that much punishment just to be able to have a car that was supremely capable at triple-digit speeds (in an era when the maximum speed limit was 70MPH -- which we have, once again, returned to here in Ohio, thankfully.)

So, perhaps the A3 really is the refined ""little"" model deserving of the Audi rings; but, to me, as capable -- at speed and a caution to the wind driving demeanor -- as the S3 is, it seems almost more like something that should have been marketed by VW or had its roughest edges filed down and more sound deadening stuffed into every crack and crevice.

My remarks, it should be emphasized, pertain mostly to the S3, and entirely to the S3 when it comes to driving impressions. An upscale Premium+ or Prestige model A3 certainly seems to fit right into the family dynamic, and hopefully the driving experience does nothing but strengthen that perception.

The S3 is a fun car and one that from time-to-time could be a hoot -- a great romp, the Jurassic World Audi, perhaps."

Hopefully this is somewhat of a public service, since I have no financial interest whatsoever in Continental Tires or The Tire Rack or The Audi Connection, despite spending money with all three entities.

The new shoes -- Continental DWS 06's -- have been on my '14 S4 (18"") and on my wife's '14 SQ5 (20"") for over 300 miles (in my case over 400 miles); and, today, July 8th, is a day befitting a duck -- steady, steady rain. The puddles have puddles, in fact.

This is really the first day I have driven with the DWS 06's on seriously wet streets, roads and highways.

Up until today, my report would have been entirely based on dry-pavement experiences. And, to put a finer point on things, the report I would give would have been easily rendered: Excellent handling, turn-in and bump absorption while being both quiet and comfortable (the latter qualified with the phrase ""for an ultra-high performance tire."")

I was in a big hurry this morning for a 9:30 meeting which required streets, secondary roads and two interstates to get to. Of course, it rains -- which, in Cincinnati, at least, brings out a driving behavior reminding me of the phrase ""deer in the headlights."" You see, Cincinnati drivers appear to never have seen rain, sleet or snow -- EVERY SINGLE TIME it rains, sleets or snows. This leads to -- hmm, seemingly endless (and unexplainable) backups when the coefficient of friction drops (like today) perhaps not much more than 10-15%. Such is life.

With some trepidation, therefore, I decided, initially, that ""ACD"" (assured clear distance) calculations had to be modified to make certain I could stop rather than ram into the ""deer"" ahead of me as he/she somehow managed to lose control of their car due to some standing water.

No worries.

The ""W"" in DWS (Dry Wet Snow) came through like a champ. The car continued to behave ""about as normal"" -- a rain soaked highway seemed little changed compared to a dry version of the same road, at least as far as I could tell behind the wheel. I half expected some earlier onset under-steer (and I'm sure it would be there at some speed) than on a dry road, but -- with my hand held high in the ""I swear"" position -- I didn't detect any even on that one curve I forgot about as I winded my way toward I-71S.

Another testimonial -- of approximately the same conclusion -- came from my wife, who was a couple of miles ahead of me (as usual) in her SQ5 with the same new shoes as mine; she and I were ""open lined"" with our mobile phones and with our traffic info nav screens set to 2 miles. She remarked how unfazed the SQ was under the circumstances. And, if you recall, she had just come from 40,000 miles on the previous gen DWS (sans 06) tires. For her the improvement in the DWS 06's vs the DWS is noticeable but not ""night and day"" noticeable; for me, on the other hand, coming from H rated Continental Grand Touring's, the DWS 06's absolutely have transformed the car into what it should have been from mile one.

Two comments on that:

#1 My fault, my bad, for not fitting DWS's on upon delivery (like we did with my wife's)

#2 Audi's fault, Audi's bad, for selling an ""S"" car with all-season Grand Touring H-rated tires; anything less than the latest and greatest all-season ultra high performance tires raises the question ""what were they thinking?""

Just because an American customer wants all-season tires, does not mean, nor does it even suggest, that the customer expects anything less than the highest performance tires available at the time the car is screwed together at the factory.

Clearly (to me at least) many folks on the other side of the pond don't get some American driver's choice to wear one set of shoes on the car year 'round. When we buy a premium sport-performance sedan -- and request all-season tires -- no where is it written that the performance capabilities of the tires should drop from ultra-high or max performance all the way down to ""H"" rated family sedan fitments. Yet, today's UHP A/S tires are a compromise -- but time and technology have advanced to a point where a tire like Continental's DWS 06 UHP A/S can provide a performance envelope virtually equal to and in some cases greater than some Max Performance tires.

I would not argue that these tires are fungible with any Extreme Performance or even most Max Performance tires -- but the DWS 06's give up virtually no ground to many other UHP summer-only tires and, as noted can sometimes match the performance of Max Perf models.

The moral, if there is one, of the story is if, like me, you don't want -- for several reasons, including ""wheel wear from tire swapping"" -- to change your tires back and forth between summer and winter tires AND you live in an area of ""moderate"" -- not heavy -- snow, these UHP All-Seasons are ""the best you can get"" [today] (until a better one comes along the day after tomorrow -- probably from Michelin).

I tried the summer winter set up once and didn't like the ""rash"" that developed on my expensive wheels. I would think, today, that the maximum set up would be as you suggest summer tires/summer wheels, winter tires/winter wheels. Having just purchased 8 new DWS 06 UHP A/S's plus paid for the mounting, balancing and all wheel alignment, I guess we're going to wait until next time, which will probably be either on the next car or 40K miles from now.

Were money no object, I would like to compare these DWS 06's to dedicated extreme performance summer only tires -- but, since money is an object, we're going to live with the current top UHP A/S's we could get.

Thus far, I do think these tires are the ones Audi should choose when the customer checks all-season tires on his/her S4. Probably will fall on deaf ears though.

Much of the US, however, has some cold without much white stuff, that is where I (speaking only for myself) would stick with the year 'round one-tire solution.

Come to think of it, were I to feel the need for a summer and a winter tire, I would almost certainly use dedicated wheel/tire combinations rather than have the wheels be ever so slightly damaged every time I changed the tires."

3462,dino001,July 2015,"This is not directly related to ELLPS, but many people here expressed their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered cars. I just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position. European Union is changing its stance on diesel emissions. Up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels. Their current testing procedures measure unrealistically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process. Moreover, those unrealistic values look better than gasoline engines. This is similar to old EPA highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc. Moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in Europe way before our administration caught the bug) lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. Carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""Inconvenient Truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently OK. This whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. All politics.

The regulators are looking now to made all emission testing realistic and using those values for certification process. The situations is reportedly so bad that, if implemented immediately, multiple models would have to be withdrawn from the market, which tells you how much skewed the setup was. Thankfully, United States government never bought into that diesel BS to the same degree. I also recall the difficulties with ""clean diesel"" implementation initiative (e.g. Navistar having to pay huge penalties on their engines because they couldn't make them compliant on time), I suspect part of that was that there was no forbearance on the testing.

I always maintained that Europeans bought diesels not by choice, but because they were made by artificial market setup. Also, American ""resistance"" to diesel was not as ""irrational"" as many people would try to make us believe. There is surely place for those engines - in agriculture, construction, heavy and midsize transportation, buses, perhaps on SUV-level. I think diesel Suburban, F-150, or even BMW X5 (or Honda Odyssey, if they made it) make perfect sense. If you have three kids and like taking long road trips, diesel would should advantages, My problem was with worshiping TDI Jettas and Passats.

Dino, you can take your stand and use it any car. Do we really need a 120K MB S600? Doesn't a 60K Lexus LS460 give the same ride and comfort?

My point is that many that say they want to see more diesels, because Europeans have them, so it must be so great, but it turns out those Europeans were convinced and coerced by their governments using tax incentives, penalties, and other means as diesels were supposed to be so great for the environment. Turns out, it was a giant con, based on phoney metrics, made to fit a story. The tide turned, it will take some years to change, but it seems diesels ain't so great when things are made equal. Once the goverments remove those preferences and even the field, you'll see European market move back toward having much more gasoline-leaning market, where diesels will have their place, but the siliness of pusing them into every model will likely stop. It will never be as barren as here, but it likely resemble what was there twenty years ago or so, when those new diesel everywhere hoopla started.

3468,markcincinnati,July 2015,"Regarding Diesels:

dino001, are there issues/circumstances that argue against diesels? I thought, here in the US, that once the fuel was cleaner and with the advent of ""ad-blue"" that the only factor arguing against diesel being widely adopted was inertia.

The message that I have bought into is that diesels -- and this means the hardware and the fuel -- produce more torque and can often achieve some 1/3 better mileage than gasoline (around here premium and diesel are often close to each other in price.) In short, I have bought into the notion that diesels can actually be fuel sipping ""hot rods."" The SQ5 which is a terrific performer, is actually offered as a diesel in Germany, for instance.

When my S4's tank is full the ""miles to empty"" reading is 400. I assumed this would mean it would be at least 520 to empty if I had the diesel set up that is in the German market SQ5 in my S4. Based on the AudiUSA website (which, for example offers up a 3.0T A6 and a diesel A6) I assumed it would be a pretty simple calculation to estimate the asking price for an S4d (if one were to be made for the US market) and to then determine how many tankfuls until break even, etc.

That ""perception"" which I somehow seem to be reading in your post, may be part true, part myth. Please elaborate -- here's why: I have been against using ""food"" to make ""gas"" since some politician, I assume, started pressing for e85 fuel; conversely, it has always seemed that diesel engines in our cars could be a good bridge to a future where we actually can use less and less fossil fuel.

I read your post, however, and I wonder if I just drank some diesel flavored kool-aid some years ago.

Again, please elaborate on your point about Europeans being coerced and apparently tricked into adopting diesels whilst we 'mericans adopted, almost universally, gasoline.

Thanks."

Ricks GT will have the DHP, since all GT's are xDrive here in the states."
3471,dino001,July 2015,"The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive. Hence the ""con"". There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western). Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines. The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault).

European Commission is trying to rectify the emission situation by tightening the standards to resemble American, but the issue is of course transition time. I believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small cars will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the US, but much less than today. The move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of Europeans, even in the West buy cars for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.

Americans never caught that bug, partially due to unrelenting of the US government on nitrogen oxide emission requirements. From what I understand it was also California that was even more ""anti-diesel"" than the feds. When you had fifth of the market excluded, there was little incentive for the manufacturers to even pursue the technology. After 20 years of apparently failed European experiment, it appears this was one of the few times, US/California governments did something right, even if not knowing why.

3496,markcincinnati,July 2015,"Wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any historical comparison available, what that might be)?

My wife and I purchased cars with manual transmissions up until 2005 when -- the cars that we wanted -- basically stopped being offered with manuals.

I did, mostly, enjoy my first 6-speed auto (a Tiptronic), but always wondered what the same car would be like with a manual. No way to tell, as a practical matter, anymore.

Then, I test drove the 2014 S4 with a manual and the 7-speed DSG (dual clutch ""automatic manual"") -- I found the DSG to provide all of the good things (except the actual depressing of the pedal) of a manual, but after a back to back demo drive (of both transmissions in otherwise identical S4's) I decided the DSG actually felt quicker, and it certainly could be a hell of a lot smoother. Moreover, I use the type of car washes where you give your car to ""the guy"" to drive through the tunnel, etc -- and I smelled a burning clutch and heard grinding gears one time too many, so I talked myself into the DSG.

Now at some 30,000+ miles later, I find the DSG to be the best transmission experience I have ever had, relegating my love of manuals to be my sentimental favorite, but not for the performance, I used to believe could only be achieved by rowing your own.

I am fortunate to also have another Audi an SQ5 with an 8-speed Tiptronic. Oddly, despite the torque converter, this iteration of the 8-speed is also better even than an S4's manual (there is no way to back to back test the SQ5 manual vs Tip since Audi only offers the SQ5 with the 8-speed.) But the 8-speed still has a hint, a vague suggestion really of being ""almost instantaneous"" making it sort of like the Coke Zero of Cola -- it's not Diet Coke, but it's not quite the real thing either.

The march forward of auto trans technology is, I would assume, largely responsible for the death and dearth of manual offerings. And, even though the DSG easily justifies its existence, I wonder if all 8-speeds are as good as the tuned version in the SQ5. I would, therefore, imagine there are other reasons for the paucity of stick shifts -- the only one I can think of is convenience, unless the real reason is ""we've"" been marketed to, so convincingly, and been convinced that we've lost the manual dexterity to undertake shifting, and that we don't really need it.

I'm going to stick with convenience as the killer of the manual.

But, I would be keenly interested in knowing the percentages if such source for that data is available.

Yeah, it's not yet clear what happened here, but it seems like it was rather abrupt. It could be that Accavitti just left for some other reason, personal or professional.

But Acura is doing reasonably well these days. It looks like sales for calendar year 2015 will be up 12% or so, maybe even getting close to 200,000 for the year. Acura's record year for sales was in 2005, when they sold 209k vehicles.

Acura now seems to have passed Cadillac in sales, which is partly because Cadillac has its own issues, and is moving up market, but still—who would have ever thought that would happen?

In any case, Jon Ikeda seems like the right person to lead Acura forward.

I became a convert when the auto versions surpassed their manual counterparts in speed. I prefer pretty much anything that improves performance. I'm not completely converted, however, as I believe the majority of automatics are still inferior to their manual counterparts.

Like you, I tend to own the cars that I drive exclusively for a very long time(Club Sport: 20 years Wrangler: 13 years, MS3: 8 years)- I'm apparently immune to the Shiny Object Syndrome. That said, at the request of my lovely bride I'm going to relent and check out a CPO 2013 E92 335is at my local dealer; it does have an almost perfect option list for my purposes- nothing but the CWP(I wish it was a sunroof delete car but those are rare as hen's teeth). And three pedals, of course. Checking out the ETK, if I were to trash the six speed-an incredibly unlikely occurrence- a BMW remanufactured replacement costs around $3600. The optional DCT? Almost $8,000- and while the DCT appears to be relatively reliable, failures have occurred.

In any event, it's probably academic, as I really liked the STI I sampled and I have yet to try a new Mustang GT with the PP.

""Edmunds.com's Best Retained Value® Awards are part of our continuing efforts to highlight vehicle value for consumers. The awards recognize the brands and models that have the highest projected private party residual value five years after their launch, expressed as a percentage of their average True Market Value® (TMV®). We assume 15,000 miles driven per year.

For 2015, Toyota won in the non-luxury division with a projected 52.4 percent residual value after five years, and Acura won the luxury crown with a projected five-year residual value of 46.9 percent. In addition to these brand-level awards, Edmunds.com issued model-level awards in 24 separate segments.

A reliable assessment of a vehicle's resale value can be a critical piece of information for car buyers. Smart car shoppers will choose vehicles with high retained value so they can maximize their worth at trade-in or sale. And for consumers who lease, selecting cars with strong resale value is just as important: Resale value is a key factor in determining the monthly lease payment.

The result is that you're running a 3 cylinder car with the 9 speed transmission at c. 1500 rpm.

Some drivers seem to really like the ZF transmission for this reason, but others really don't. Some people seem to have jerky and ""hunt for the gear"" shifting issues at low speeds.

So for the Acura TLX it seems like a win some/lose some world going from their 6 speed to the 9 speed tranny.

Cadillac engineers told me repeatedly that they didn't set out to ""out-BMW BMW"" or ""chase the M5."" Fair enough. My gut feeling is that former M5 owners might love this CTS-V if they gave it a true test, but I understand that what drives one person to purchase a six-figure (or nearly) German performance sedan might not be sated with a domestic badge. But the Cadillac certainly makes a strong case for itself when spec sheets are measured.

Take the previously cited competitive set from Audi, BMW, and Mercedes for example: The CTS-V has a clear power advantage over all of them. The M5 gives up 80 hp and 130 lb-ft, the RS 7 80 hp and 113 lb-ft, and the E63 by an appropriate 63 hp and 40 lb-ft. The Cadillac is the lightest of the bunch, undercutting by anywhere from 130 to 330 pounds, and only the all-wheel-drive Mercedes is quicker to 60, by two tenths of a second. But you'll have to pay out of the nose to get those tenths: the E-Class is about $17,000 more expensive, base to base. Meanwhile, the Bimmer is roughly ten grand more dear, and the slant-back Audi about twenty-five. You pays your money and takes your choice, and all that, but even for rich guys that's not chump change."
3527,markcincinnati,August 2015,"""I Can't Drive 55!""

You must know by my id here that I live in Cincinnati. The SMSA of this city is about 1.5M the last time I looked. The city itself has a population of under 400K. Technically, then, most of us don't live in the city. I earn my living, however in the corp limit, as does my wife.

I drive to work -- or at least I used to -- on two interstates: I-275 and I-71. I have tried driving on these interstates at the early and late ""normal"" times, and find myself often putt putting along at whatever speed the car can manage ""at idle."" In winter, it is even worse.

I have now taken to driving on secondary roads and residential streets -- just to be able to get to 35MPH - 50MPH.

I am, currently, driving an Audi S4 -- a car that in the blink of an eye can almost reach triple digit speeds and the thing feels like it is on rails, making it a great hi-way cruiser, capable of an easy-peasy drive from Cincinnati to Columbus at speeds north of 80MPH.

I have not driven an RS7, I have driven a 2015 S6, however, and even that was somewhat frustrating since it is capable of feats of fancy that are virtually impossible on the roads I drive to go about my business.

I used to think if I had ""Trump Money"", I would certainly go for a super-car or at least an ""entry-level super car."" Not any more.

I really enjoy my S4 -- the few times I've been able to really push it, I have been impressed with its ""performance envelope."" I suspect I would find going back to a 2.0T equipped A4 a let down. But, I also suspect I would find moving forward with an RS4 (if a sedan version were to be made available in the US) would be a let down, too -- or at least immensely frustrating.

An unlimited bank account would allow me to acquire, for instance, an RS7 or whatever else might pass these days as a super sedan (an M5, too, would qualify). But what advantage would I have -- I rarely can use the full accelerative force my pedestrian S4 provides. Were I to attempt to ""punch it"" I would, more often than not, find myself overtaking and potentially ramming (""rig for ramming speed"") the pokey car in front of me.

Cutting yet another second+ off of my ability to accelerate would be -- in theory -- fun and potentially a safety feature (if you say it real fast and squint, 0-62MPH in 3.7 seconds could be a safety feature, couldn't it?) But, uh, REALLY? I think it is safe to say it is so highly unlikely I could ever use that much quickness, it would just be very, very frustrating. Heck, it is already frustrating with the ""urge"" my lowly S4 musters.

So, I have reached a point where I lust for the kind of performance that is available and, currently, unaffordable -- but I also balance that lust with the reality that it is not virtually impossible to use such power, it is literally impossible to do so.

So, I ask myself, why bother -- traffic is not getting any better, speeds are not getting any higher, abilities to actually use such accelerative force are waning as each day passes.

I'm just about ready to use public transportation -- oh wait, we don't have much of that here in River City, so I have to putt putt along in my ""entry level super sedan"" (well sort of), wondering what it would be like to, as my buddy says, ""punch it.""

DILYL -- 55MPH actually would be an improvement."
3528,Mr_Shiftright,August 2015,"I think you should get yourself some quick and agile dwarf car, like a Mini or Fiat Abarth. I find cars like these so much easier to drive in traffic and if you equip them correctly, they aren't the least bit spartan. Unfortunately, not cheap either."

Besides, I drove a mini and they aren't exactly what I would call ""quick.""

I'm not so much lamenting the continuous move up in power as I am the continuous creep of traffic congestion and the resulting slow down of movement.

My friend who lives in Dallas says even urban Texas is suffering from progressive reduction of the speed at which one can drive and accelerate. And, I'm living in about as much ""middle of nowhere"" as I would want to tolerate.

Having been to Germany many times, I am impressed how it is still possible to have a high speed autobahn and fairly high speed train transportation even around the major cities. An American Autobahn would certainly be refreshing -- probably not gonna happen though.

Mean time, it seems we will have to put up with cars that are generally overkill in terms of their performance capabilities."

""Cadillac Boss De Nysschen Sticks to Guns with High Lease Prices

Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen, a.k.a. the architect of what many hope would be the luxury brand’s grand comeback, hasn’t had it easy at times. Most recently, he was scored by several dealers in New York who want him to make Cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.

If you ask de Nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand. But is it still the right thing to do when Cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity? Consider that Caddy’s international rivals – Audi, BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period. Once again, Cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de Nysschen may need to do more. For one, Cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the CTS sedan and ATS coupe are suffering in the sales race.

One tool Cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles. In a Bloomberg special report, Potamkin Cadillac (Manhattan) general manager John Bruno related that the CTS once cost under $400 per month to lease. But now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable BMW....""

The ATS sales are particularly disappointing.
Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes. ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either.

I wonder if that's just Cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy. For years good old GM was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"" , but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy. Perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before. One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. How difficult is that? Extremely. Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club). The previous GM had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible. Not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can. The road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.

Cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. It was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception. By the time around 50s -60s it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer. It meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a Cadillac dealership. It's not like Jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge Ford Mondeo experiment. Today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product. Cadillac is simply too big for that. They need volumes. I think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (CTS and ATS) are best they have ever been.

To each his/her own.
In luxury goods segment, the customization of the taste allows for big premium. It's actually part of the appeal - to have something others don't. Others may have something similar, but not the same. This is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options. BMW used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their 3-series, just in the US market, this was before splitting off 4-series (I can't even imagine, how many you could have in Europe, when you have three times as many engines).

Some people are willing to pay for being different. X5/X6, A6/A7, BMW's GT or GC lines are all catering to those people. It's probably expensive to make those short lines of different bodies, so you have to pay to get them. I consider those ""butique"" lines an equivalent of special leather, Bang and Oluffsen audio, or other high premium options. Some people won't see a value in that (for you it's ""the same"" car), others will tell you that look is worth 10 grand. Just like some people would say that premium leather or audio system are marginal for them and they won't pay 5 grand for those (they may be nice, just not five grand nice).

I was truly disappointed when Kudlow didn't follow up with ""And whose fault was that?"". GM was still paying a dividend, big bonuses, spending money left and right. They should have stopped the dividend, start hoarding money well in advance of a planned contract renewal to the point that they could outlast the Union - just like literally everybody else in the machinery business did in 80s and 90s. Some actually went bankrupt (Cummins), others went into long strike (Caterpillar), until they broke the power of their union. But that would have been uncomfortable. Perhaps even bonuses wouldn't be paid, as self-set artificial sales goals wouldn't have been met, the stock would have been down for a while.

3553,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Cadillac's push to raise the price of the CTS to -- I assume -- 5-series territory is not based on a bad theory, it is just that it was [obviously] too early. A CTS at a 3-series price probably could have/should have continued for a bit longer. Those wanting a CTS/5-series sized car were, I think, heading to Cadillac for ""premium+value"" -- isn't this what Lexus did from day-one?

Now, a buyer with a 3-series budget goes into the Cadillac showroom, thinking he/she might drive out with a CTS and gets a bit of a shock upon seeing the MSRP of the CTS. I imagine the buyer isn't interested in an ATS after his plans to drive off in an American 5-series for a 3-series price have been dashed.

I would also imagine the unintended consequences of the CTS being priced at 5-series levels would be the buyer just goes ahead and gets a 3-series or perhaps finds a ""Summer of Audi"" lease deal that is too good to pass up.

I think the CTS, at the same price as a 5-series, is, today, too much wishful thinking on the part of De Nysschen and his marketing team.

The market isn't ready, yet, to accept a CTS priced like a 5-series.

Pity.

And, whoever wrote about my purchasing proclivities is dead-on: While I would not pay nearly $10,000 more for an A7 when I could have an identically equipped A6 for less, I would gladly pony up the $10,000 for optional extras like leather, electronics, wheels/tires and other factory-exclusive customization. Of course, I'd probably wrap it in a pure white colored car, since I also have an issue paying $1,075 for some off-beat blue color option, but would pay for B&O speakers in a heartbeat.

Cadillac has what, an Escalade?

Were I in charge, I think I would -- for a while -- go for the ""land-grab"" approach to market share. I am certain that is exactly what Lexus did when they came out with a car that lured Mercedes shoppers into the showroom and had these shoppers test drive a Lexus that essentially did everything a Mercedes did but for some 20% less money. Today, I believe the big Merc and the big Lexus cars sell for similar sums and it is accepted.

My friend always bought 7-series, for a long long long time; eventually he bought an LS400 (or whatever the 7-series sized car from Lexus was/is), bought another one after that, too. I ran into him taking delivery of an Audi A8L recently. My how times have changed.

I assume he might, someday, consider a Cadillac -- but for the kind of money that this list of cars has cost him over the years, I have to assume he wouldn't consider any Cadillac worth some number beginning with an 8.

Actually, Lincoln is now making a come back. Sales were up a solid 21% for Lincoln in July. They had their best July sales of the last 10 years. Lincoln is a ""value"" luxury brand. If they keep it up, and Caddy continues their misguided free fall, they might someday trade places in the sales rankings. This is actually a big opportunity for Lincoln for ""conquest"" sales from their long-time competitor.

""Cadillac Boss De Nysschen Sticks to Guns with High Lease Prices

Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen, a.k.a. the architect of what many hope would be the luxury brand’s grand comeback, hasn’t had it easy at times. Most recently, he was scored by several dealers in New York who want him to make Cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.

If you ask de Nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand. But is it still the right thing to do when Cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity? Consider that Caddy’s international rivals – Audi, BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period. Once again, Cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de Nysschen may need to do more. For one, Cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the CTS sedan and ATS coupe are suffering in the sales race.

One tool Cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles. In a Bloomberg special report, Potamkin Cadillac (Manhattan) general manager John Bruno related that the CTS once cost under $400 per month to lease. But now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable BMW....""



The reason the leases are expensive is because you have a high inflated MSRP selling price joining the reality of how much they are actually worth at the end of the lease. Someone has to pay for that, in the past it has been tax payers, but most think another bailout won't be granted, so you can't rely on that anymore.

Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes. ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either.

I wonder if that's just Cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy. For years good old GM was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"" , but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy. Perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before. One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. How difficult is that? Extremely. Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts namethey will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club). The previous GM had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible. Not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can. The road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.

Cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. It was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception. By the time around 50s -60s it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer. It meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a Cadillac dealership. It's not like Jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge Ford Mondeo experiment. Today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product. Cadillac is simply too big for that. They need volumes. I think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (CTS and ATS) are best they have ever been.
I think a big mistake was made keeping the Cadillac/GM names/brands around. They should have renamed and re-badged everything to try and get a cleaner slate from previously burned buyers. They should have followed the example set by GMAC, which became ALLY and they didn't exactly advertise the fact. Change your name, don't use any letters from your previous name (OK; Ally uses the A in GMAC; vowels will be forgiven). So think up a name that doesn't have the letters ""GM"" or ""Cdllc"" in it!

Absolutely and I said this in these forums during the BK. The GM fans would still have bought the newly renamed GM, and the GM non-fans would be MUCH more likely to buy a vehicle from a revamped company that wasn't named GM. Remember Valujet? They renamed to AirTran and became quite successful until bought by Southwest, in spite of a bad crash and maintenance problems. The name change wiped a lot of the memory away."

Yes. It seems like some Cadillac dealers are literally begging for mercy. And it seems like they're not getting any. I imagine that low volume dealers in smaller cities have helped enlarge Cadillac's overall numbers for decades. But now management might look down at those dealers, which might not be glitzy, and might not have customers who can pay prices higher than BMW's for today's Caddys.

Lincoln’s division has needed a rebound in sales for some time. There have been suggestions that Ford shutter the brand because it has posted such poor numbers.

Led by sharp improvements in MKC and MKX sales, SUV numbers were up 39.3% to 6,350.

Cadillac’s drop came despite its management’s forecast that the brand is in the midst of a turnaround. Cadillac sales fell 7.1% in July to 14,154 compared to July of 2014. The numbers would have been far worse if the performance of its SRX crossover were not so strong. Its sales grew by 46.8% to 6,753. The SRX was Cadillac’s top-selling vehicle. Numbers for its cars were abysmal. ATS sales fell 38.5% to 1,588. Sales of its CTS dropped 27.5% to 1,515. Sales of the XTS dropped 32.9% to 1,302. Cadillac management has run out of excuses.

For those of me who care about these kind of things -- headline:

""Audi sets 55th straight monthly U.S. record with 20.8% gain in July 2015!""

If we start going back those 55 months, I believe we would come to a period where De Nysschen was at the healm -- the fact that things kept humming along after his departure is, I think, NOT an indication that the top guy doesn't matter, but rather an indication of how the products are perceived by the market.

As I dust off my graduate school marketing textbook (which is probably, by now woefully out of date), all evidence suggests EITHER to raise prices or increase market share by some method that leaves the perception of ""big bucks"" undamaged.

My leasing guru says: sub-vent the leases like there's no tomorrow, get the current product out and seen by the market; meanwhile work behind the scenes on getting products to the market that people WANT (translation Audi Q3, Q5 and Q7 rivals and BMW X1, X3, X4, X5 and X6 rivals).

If you ax me, the money spent bringing the all electric Caddy to market was a nice idea, but I don't see it as helpful to what ought to be the bread and butter ATS.

Isn't it true that for Audi THE meat and potatoes car is the A4 as the 3 series is for BMW? Shouldn't Cadillac at least consider doing whatever it takes to get ""a lot more"" ATS's in the hands of customers by almost any method (sub-vented leases being a good tool, typically)?

Or is it that the cars themselves just aren't ""gettin' it done?"" So no matter what you do within reason, some people will still say ""The Emperor Has no Clothes.""

One last random thought, the Audi dealer I shop is owned by a group that also owns a Cadillac dealership a couple blocks away -- so naturally, we do tend to browse that dealership since they know my wife and me as long time loyal ""dealer group"" customers. I have priced cars at the dealership and they are as stubborn as can be about the price they will use to run the numbers, whereas the Audi group seems willing to put the best deal on the table first. The experience at the Audi dealership is what I call horizontal sales, due to the fact that the sales staff is so laid back you have to wake them to get them to sell you the car; the Cadillac dealership still seems to employ a technique from yesteryear, with salesreps dressed in clothes one size too small and largely lacking in product knowledge beyond what they can glean just by looking at the sticker.

The approach at the Cadillac dealership is, well, disappointing, even as the cars are getting somewhat more interesting and competitive.

ELKHART LAKE, Wis. -- Two main elements of Johan de Nysschen’s plan to rehabilitate Cadillac’s image are to tighten dealers’ inventories and quash their sell-at-any-cost mentality.

There’s a big problem though: Cadillac’s dealer-incentive programs today are designed to do just the opposite. One makes cash payouts for growing sales; the other attaches up to $700 in dealer bonus money to every vehicle they order from the factory.

De Nysschen, Cadillac’s president, says those programs must change for dealers to adopt a true luxury mindset, one based on an engaging customer experience, rather than sales volume.

“The business model has been structured more for the bigger brands inside General Motors, rather than the small Cadillac brand,” de Nysschen said here at a test drive event for the media. “The luxury business is different.”

He said Cadillac is in talks with its national dealer council “to develop the next generation of what these programs should look like for Cadillac.”

It’s an example of the obstacles de Nysschen faces in reshaping Cadillac’s retail network into something that more closely resembles those of German luxury brands such as BMW or Audi. Most of Cadillac’s more than 900 dealerships are hard-wired to carry far more inventory than other luxury stores, often moving the metal through deep discounts.

A Midwest Cadillac dealer, who didn’t want to be identified discussing factory business, believes it would be difficult for many dealers to fathom an incentive program that’s not tied to sales performance.

“There’s only one thing that matters, and it’s selling more cars,” said the dealer, who said he sells a couple dozen Cadillacs a month. “I did not come in here today to buy more digital stuff for the showroom.”

3601,markcincinnati,August 2015,"8 Years? Really?

Check out this headline: ""Knowledge Doubling Every 12 Months, Soon to be Every 12 Hours""!

While you're at it, check out any number of sources on the subject line ""Moore's law"": The observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.

""Buckminster Fuller created the “Knowledge Doubling Curve”; he noticed that until 1900 human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II knowledge was doubling every 25 years. Today things are not as simple as different types of knowledge have different rates of growth. For example, nanotechnology knowledge is doubling every two years and clinical knowledge every 18 months. But on average human knowledge is doubling every 13 months. According to IBM, the build out of the “internet of things” will lead to the doubling of knowledge every 12 hours.""

OK, so where oh where is this going?

This is going to the subject of why the refresh cycles of cars (German ones at least) seems to be (especially for Audi and BMW) 8 years.

Sure there are ""mid-cycle"" refreshes, but often what happens is some minor styling tweaks, perhaps an MPG increase and certainly an increase in ""content"" -- but, often content increases annually (sometimes for a bump in price) anyway, or at least there is a rejiggering of option package features.

What if Apple came out with a truly new phone once every 8 years? What if Lenovo or Dell only coughed up a new PC or server even as long as every 4 years? There are numerous other examples across many products and brands that would literally just drop dead if they didn't substantially change (one likes to think enhance and improve) their products much more frequently than 8 or 4 or even 2 years.

Given current technology advancements, check that, given the speed (and frequency) of technology advancements how is it that several significant car manufacturers only really offer more than evolutionary changes every 8-years?

And while incremental changes continue in years 2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8, it is -- as far as I can tell -- literally impossible to upgrade your year 2 version with year 6 features, for any realistic sum of money (and in some cases it is less money to replace your 5 year old BMW with a new one than even dream of [analogy] pulling out the old SIMM chip and replacing it with a new one.)

So much of our cars DNA is based on software and a circuit board, why not allow the customer who wants to pony up the funds to upgrade his/her car's ""infotainment"" system for the one found in a newer version of his A4 or 5 series?

Is the only reason to not support an upgrade path the desire to sell new cars? Why can you keep your 20 year old aircraft current with the latest and greatest avionics, but your can't upgrade your 2 year old car's 3G wi-fi to 4G LTE for love nor money?

And the refresh cycle at 8-years? Really? Why does it take 8 years between ""versions"" of these cars? That time frame seems to me to be based on the past, not the currently reality.

I think it is time for the refresh cycle to be shortened -- I'd say, based on where things stand today, cutting the cycle in half would pretty much be a catch up move, not a pull ahead move.

The days of rendering umpteen versions of a new design in clay, destroying them and doing it all over again, are inefficient -- so much so that if anyone is actually still doing this, it would have to be almost literally ineffective.

I've seen some very impressive 3D-printing demonstrations that would seem to eliminate such by-gone days' practices -- the model upgrade can be dreamed up, coded and the printer turned on; model change costs can be slashed as can the time from thought to manufacture to market. No way 8-years is required to recoup the development costs.

Computer controlled machines can be changed to produce new body stampings, etc and every day it is not impossible to believe some engineer somewhere has figured out yet another tweak to improve both power and MPG out of the internal combustion engine -- to say nothing of alternative power-trains.

So, today's car is part mechanical, part computational, part software, part hardware -- I've kept my iPhone current, and so far each upgrade has been a real improvement. This technology is in our cars and it should be similarly updatable (the time frame, the cycle) and notable improvements should be regular and frequent -- not for free, mind you, but this 8-year cycle between serious product upgrades and updates is a practice that needs to be abandoned as soon as possible."
3602,tlong,August 2015,"Cars are over 100 years into their evolution and other than electronics, don't evolve at the same pace.

Smart phones are like 8 years old (if we count the iPhone as the first ""modern"" smartphone; a bit longer if you count earlier ""windows mobile"" phones). So of course the pace of evolution is much faster.

Auto volumes are also a lot lower. So it's too expensive to retool every year - unless you want to pay triple the cost. And a car represents a much higher fraction of the average owner's income, so it is not going to be replaced at the same pace as your phone.

Regarding software and automakers, this is a very new area for them. They are not that experienced in software at the consumer level. Recent security exploits show how far the automakers need to go to get to the same level of sophistication that Apple or Microsoft are at for their operating systems."
3603,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Opportunity Lost

My suggestion was for a cycle of ~4-years, not 1. Also, the experience of driving the automobile is, as I noted, largely based on software and circuit boards. Engine bays can almost certainly house either the tried and true and tired 3.7L (Infiniti, e.g.) or a new cleaner, more efficient and more effective powerplant (make the new stuff available now, don't wait for a new body style, i.e.) -- the point is I was only partially speaking of ""retooling."" Moreover, now that machines make machines, the cost of retooling has decreased.

But again, my request is for a compression of time for updates to the brain, heart and lungs (so to speak) of the automobile; later, or less frequently if there is a retooling argument at play, the ritual ""skin rejuvenation"" and lipo-suction can be scheduled.

Let me give a few examples of ""improvements"" that probably don't required new sheet metal to deploy (and I'll use Audi as my poster-child since I am familiar with that brand):

o Audi will wait to offer LED headlights until the B9 model (A4), but the technology has been in the ""C's"" (A6) for a couple of years. I can think of no legitimate reason this feature was withheld from the market.

o Top-view monitor, as much, or more, of an advance as the rear-view camera, has been around for years -- Audi will wait for the B9 class debuts before they offer this.

o Driver configurable dash (EFT tech), it too will have to wait for the next generation car

o 4G LTE internet connectivity -- also will have to wait, and no upgrade path is offered for older 3G radios buried in the MMI's guts. This ought to be like opening up your laptop, pulling the hard drive and replacing it with an SSD (all for $150 or less) and enjoying the performance of a no-moving-parts storage system without having to buy an entirely new PC

The list of features that could make the car perform better, be safer, have better in-car entertainment, navigation and driver assist aids do not require much, if any, retooling, but they would allow owners to keep their car's systems, on a selective basis, as current as the owner wants.

Perhaps this has little to do with capability or cost (to both the mfgr and the customer), perhaps it really is a way to compel (or at least impel) ""the market"" (you and me, perhaps, at the micro level) to trade in, trade up or just ""get new"" -- perhaps the status quo is as we know it today, to imbue aftermarket providers (SEMA) with endless opportunities to sell their wares. Who knows perhaps the mfgrs and SEMA companies are in a symbiotic relationship (I doubt they actually collude, however).

It just frustrates the ever-lovin' crap out of me to be almost unable to keep my cars as current as possible. I'd like to be able to pick and choose some of this year's features and incorporate them into my otherwise fine 3-year old.

Seems like you can put new wheels and tires on your car with ease -- and W/T combinations can provide performance, safety and styling improvements -- I just believe we have reached a point in time and technology where we ought to be able to do the same thing with the ""technology package"" most cars come standard with, these days (speaking of the PREMIUM CLASS, of course, for this and other posts).

A really big clue, to me at least, as to the lost opportunity mfgrs are ""enjoying"" is revealed over on audiworld.com where members breathlessly enthuse about the arrival (yesterday or the day before) of their new cars, then, in the next sentence, conclude ""Let the modifications begin.""

Lost opportunity if you ax me.

Sort-of unrelated: I finally met my very first non-Apple employee who was wearing an Apple Watch. As she explained it to me, it sounded pretty cool -- until she told me, that if you wanted to do almost anything other than tell time, you had to have your iPhone within about 30-50 feet of your wrist; meaning, effectively, you have to carry the phone to get much, if any, use out of the watch's smart features. I'm hereby volunteering to have an iPhone implanted -- with a charging plug inconspicuously positioned somewhere on my torso. You see: I'm looking to have empty pockets -- while they're at it, they can implant my smart car-key too (Audi keys are about the size of a small potato, for god's sake); I'd rather the car key be included with the car as a stylish and functional Mont Blanc pen. Seriously, I'm starting to list from the weight of all of the ""remotes"" and do-dads and clips and cards I carry in my pockets. Somebody help me, somebody help us all."
3604,tlong,August 2015,"The automakers would much rather have you buy a new car for tens of thousands rather than plug and play a few modules and keep your current vehicle for a few more years.
The technology may ""be there"" to do new things sooner, but it's certainly not a no-cost proposition to continually re-tool parts as plug in replacements for previous ones. And it adds a lot of logistical complexity, too. Your headlight goes out - do you want one non-LED replacement, or two of the new LED equivalents? Let's stock duplicate sets of parts for all the different vintages and variants and versions of parts that are usable in the same basic model of car...etc. And the engineers retrofitting the LED lights to the existing Audi vehicles, the new LTE module to the existing vehicles, the new CPU to the existing vehicles - well they won't be working on designing the next model coming out in a few years then... unless you hire excess engineers for that...

The Apple watch (and Android Wear as well) are designed to be mostly peripheral devices to your phones. The battery technology just isn't there to have much power in the watch and have it still run all day."
3605,dino001,August 2015,"markcincinnati said:

The biggest issue I see is production cycle and spare parts. While it may be cheaper to retool than it used to be, it is still expensive. Moreover, by law of many countries the manufacturers have to keep spare parts of their models for many years, I think it is ten or so. Increase number of variations and shorten the lifespan and the cost goes up, perhaps disproportionately.

What options did you do?

The MB Tex is of high quality and the contrasting stitching make it look very upscale, BMW could learn a thing about that.

I think MB did a good job with the new C class, I haven't driven one yet, but will in the next year."
3608,dino001,August 2015,"MB Tex may be looking upscale, but it ain't. A friend of mine has an older C-class and it positively does not breath, giving you hot and sweaty feel in summer days, which is half of the time in Florida. Combine it with absolutely ridiculous price MB charges for the leather seats and any other significant option and very low in-stock availability (for that reason) and I have no interest in anything Benz. I once entered building C-class, but existed at around 55 grand for C300 (didn't even finish just yet) and 60+ grand for C400. No, thank you. Compared with those, 3-series is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to MB everything looks like one).

Sure, C-class looks better inside, but almost nobody buys 3-series for their interiors (if anything, those have always been deterrent rather lure). C-class is bigger, but that's not necessarily a good thing in ELLPS - those are not bough per pound or cubic foot.

It's a fine vehicle, if you like that sort of thing, but it is priced just silly. If you break down pricing to the car and the logo on the hood, it seems to me they charge for the star about double or triple of what BMW does (and admittedly BMW charges double or triple of what Acura does). In other words, the star on the hood costs literally thousands of dollars. I wonder how much dealers sell it for as a spare part

MB sometimes gives to dealers very substantial cash incentives once the novelty wears off and they are pretty good in hiding them from the public, so the brand stays protected, but even with that I'm not interested.
2018 430i Gran Coupe"
3609,graphicguy,August 2015,"Dino, I've been on a couple of test drives in the new C Class. Pretty impressive, IMHO. Certainly the interior is the best of the class bunch. I do agree about the MBTex vs Leather. Some say you can't tell the difference. I certainly can, and it's not even close. That being the case, the real leather of the one I drove with the sport seats was of high quality.

I do think that the Turbo V6 is a bit of overkill in the car, but it does compare favorably to a 335i or S4. Perhaps that's because the turbo 4 is so smooth and responsive in the C300. The C400 I drove came in at the mid $50s. The C300 in the low $50s. Pricewise, I don't think the Mercedes is disadvantaged at all against the 3 Series or A/S Audis similarly equipped.

The dealer that I talked to said he'd take 10% off MSRP off any C he had in stock. That was a couple of months ago. So, not sure if it's still the case, but that makes a very, very nice C Class price extremely competitive.

NYC...one of the ones I test drove was a metallic grey C300 sport with the lip spoiler and front chin spoiler. It had red leather sport seats and the open pore wood accoutrements....very sharp. It came in at the high $40s. Dealer said the same as you....about $3,500 more for the same car with the V6 bi-turbo. Personally, I'd save the $3,500 and stick with the 4 pot....and that's saying something about how good the turbo 4 is. In all frankness, I am growing to love all these Turbo 4s these days, regardless of manufacturer. They're really torquey and provide excellent MPG.

I think you're right. Perhaps something changed, or I checked something too much. It is low 50s, indeed, which is similar to a loaded 328. BMW has galloped their prices recently well beyond what it used to be. I remember being absolutely shocked first time I optioned one to a comparable equipment with my E91 wagon. It was something like five grand more on the sticker and still couple of things missing. Admittedly, mine was last year of production, with several options thrown in gratis, or well discounted, but still, the difference was enormous. So I may stand corrected on this. It is annoying though, when local Benz dealer in my area have absolutely no faith in their customers' real wealth, if all they order is MB Tex on C-class (also GLA, CLA). Even E-class comes with MB Tex standard and large percentage of units on dealers' lots have it, which I find absolutely ridiculous. It apparently works. I wonder if that's something people don't realize until it's too late, or something people know, but don't care.

2018 430i Gran Coupe"
3615,breld,August 2015,"The purchase of the S3 for my wife a couple weeks ago may have accelerated my plans for the Mazda3 being a fun ""in-between"" car.

Test drove several S4s this past weekend (couple used ones and a couple new ones, manual and automatic).

Also looked at a 328d wagon and a 428i gran coupe (x drive).

Wife and I both have historically been very pro-BMW. But ours have almost all been more ""enthusiast-oriented"" (wife had a wagon much like dino's (m-sport manual)), and neither of us are getting too excited about the current models. The 328d wagon I drove felt somewhat ordinary. To be fair, it wasn't as equipped as we would like, but nevertheless it had a sticker of $55k.

The 428i I really enjoyed and do love the body style for its looks and functionality. The one I drove was a sport-line and pretty well equipped for the low $50k's. If I really checked the boxes for all the options I would like, it gets to the high $50k's pretty quickly.

So having said all that, I'm probably leaning more toward an S4. It's actually quite the value in comparison to some of the other cars I looked at. I think they've done a good job updating the tech in the car to keep it up to date in that way for such an outgoing model. I find it endearing that a car that's been around for so many years is still holding its own against the competition (and then some). And, it's nice Audi still offers the choice of the manual and auto.

If I can hold out for awhile, I may still wait to see the new model.

I'll be a dissenting voice here and say I like the styling of the new C-class. I think it offers a different, elegant alternative to the comparable BMW and Audi. I do agree it looks a bit too much like the CLA, but not sure that's a bad thing.

@nyccarguy - I'm with you that the sport package design elements and wheels add a lot to the overall aesthetic.

I received a exemplary comment over the weekend regarding my silver Q50S...the gentleman was early-20's.

""I really like your car, sir""...what a Gentleman!
Sometimes I just cringe when someone calls me sir -- I think it heralds the beginning of the end.

I was driving into the office today and made an attempt (1/2 hour commute) to note the age of the driver of every Mercedes I saw. I only saw E's and S's, but I did see a double digit number. I did not make any attempt to categorize by gender or apparent ethnicity. My memory says I saw only two ethnic groups represented ""black and white"" -- and of course two genders.

What struck me was the apparent fact that the E's and S's were all AWD versions and were all driven by what certainly appeared to me to be people beyond their 50's. Is this observation in any way statistically significant? Probably not, but it could be, at least, an interesting data-point. I drive through mostly upper-middle income neighborhoods on my commute, FWIW.

Before you think I've gone off some rail here, I was having a conversation with a friend about cars and the subject of Cadillac came up -- his comment was that they remain cars that attract ""mature"" owners, retired folk, apparently in his view.

The article above about the efforts of the new Cadillac President to change the behavior (mentality) of dealers made me think he was onto something. Cadillac dealers don't act like Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealers -- and they still paint prices on the windshields of the cars on their lots (I make it a practice to avoid dealers who paint prices on the windshield of the cars on their lot, I fear them, frankly.)

My perception is that BMW has the youngest drivers of the German Premium Crowd, closely followed by Audi (but that may be because of the Q5's success -- and that it would appear Q5's have a relatively young owner-set.) Audi, too, with the A3/S3 may be trolling for ever younger owners.

But, that still leaves me with the observation -- this morning -- that the E and S class Mercs were AWD and all driven by, apparently, Baby Boomers, current Xer's and Millennial's weren't participating this AM, at least.

Here I am 64, driving an S4 -- I guess I should be in what -- an A6 or CTS or perhaps a 5 series or should it be an XTS Cadillac. Wondering what, if any, studies of the age of owners exists -- with all the focus on Millennials and away from us Boomers, these days, it would seem to be some valuable data.

Ever notice the current crop of Buick ads wherein the ""little ol' lady"" remarks ""Oh MY!"" when she is told she's in a new Buick. Is that a nod toward the past or is that a convoluted way of suggesting that new Buicks will be appreciated by those of a certain maturity and perhaps even attractive to them?

Wondering if part of the issue confronting some car mfgrs, could be they need to make their cars seem to be desired by Millennials.

I'd concur that there is a very good chance for it. Similar with rental cars - I recently got a PUG Mazda MX-5. After I refueled it with PUG (it was a long mileage rental), the car got much more lively. I'm pretty sure it was full of RUG.

Only knowing the mean does not provide enough information to declare that ""about half"" of the buyers are old codgers. To have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often. The issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish.

I was quite surprised to see the average age of BMW buyers was ""THAT OLD!"" But, you see, I've been going to the BMW Store here in Cincinnati at least since the mid 1980's, and my impression is that the show room is full of shoppers who are ""really really young"" -- and I have always presumed well-to-do. I went the Audi route when all my friends went with BMW's because #1 the Audi brand had quattro and #2, I always felt you could buy the next higher line of Audi for the same price as the lower line BMW, so I thought the value and performance leader was always Audi (you could say, too, I guess, I was, ahem, more frugal than my BMW lovin' friends).

But back to the math -- an average age of 60 does not mean the majority of buyers are over 60. There isn't enough information to know, if all you know is the ""average."" Mean, Mode, Median, Range and while were at it Standard Deviation, on the other hand would paint a much clearer picture of the number of ""old timers"" buying a particular automotive brand.

I have one more data point -- every Corvette that I have seen FOR YEARS seems to be piloted by a driver who either looks like Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby (speaking ONLY of a certain appearance that suggests age, not lasciviousness.)

3652,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Yeah, you're right, what I said at the OPENING of my post should have been repeated ""about half""-- yet, average just doesn't give enough information to know other than to take a guess that ""probably"" your 50% number (61) is ""probable.""

It's the numbers on the fringes that can really muck up the meaning of average. My interest would be in knowing a bit more. I mean it, BMW, as we all know, stands for Beauty, Money and Wealth -- and in my experience the BMW owners, shoppers and drivers are YOUNG and possess beauty, money and wealth.

well, the Acura dealer does offer them. But in 3 years, I have never been in for anything that wasn't covered under the express service, so I never had to stay more than an hour, so no point in leaving. Hyundai, well, that had 1 oil change, so I just waited.

our Honda dealer (when I used them a lot) just had a shuttle. mostly I just waited for the express service. the few times i needed to leave it, either took the shuttle or had the wife drop me off.

Hopefully I never have to deal with the VW dealer, outside of 1x year oil change!

Aw c'mon now. These are more than badge jobs. They are shared platforms with little shared outside of that. Should we chastise VW for sharing an 8 year old platform between the current A4 and the new Porsche Macan?"

3665,dino001,August 2015,"I'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today. It's about making cars different enough. There are examples of successful platform sharing, such as VAG, where to various degree there are shared components between Skoda, Seat, VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other. A domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be Cadillac Escalade - regardless how much detest Cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with Pharao, Raja, Louis-X??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from GMC. An example for the opposite also comes from Cadillac - Cimarron.

GM's overall track record of putting different badges on practically identical vehicles makes me, should I say, skeptical. They got better, recently. I think Buicks seem to be regaining their own identity, but seems GM is slowly falling back into its old ways - unrealistic expectations, lots of puffery, and lack of support of their dealers, see Graphic's CTS saga, which seems to stem from multiple dealers' unwillingness to troubleshoot the car without a fault code, which is most likely because GM's refusal to give them enough leeway to work the problem first. They can't win luxury market customers, if their dealers act this way, but they do that because of the toxic relationships. Moreover, there are probably too many stores for the brand to be truly upscale.

So they trump half million sales target in 5 years, which is high teens growth each year, every year, with currently crashing sales in some key US segments. I understand, big part of the growth is supposed to come from China, which I think is OK, even if recent news suggest a calamity unfolding there (I think it's way overstated).

How do you grow sales, when in fact you need to shrink the store count and apply more discipline? It's all completely inconsistent. As I said before, it's a ten year project with very difficult first three-four years and no guarantee for a success. They are unwilling to swallow that bitter pill (what's new about that), they'd rather do what they have always done - peacocking, unrealistic baffoonery. Seems like the bankruptcy taught them absolutely nothing. Looks like the new outsider guy fits their old mold quite well.

3666,markcincinnati,August 2015,"It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. Or did the competition creep their prices upward?

Eventually Sony showed up in Walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, Sony did keep the image of being the Premium Brand.

Lexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, said to be comparable to Mercedes, and charged 20% less. Over time, Lexus was able to inflate the MSRP of the cars to near parity with the premium Germans.

Two approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.

Cadillac seems to be working the Sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""Cadillac is back."" This is time consuming, expensive and probably WILL WORK ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""

The Lexus -- Land Grab -- approach also has its merits. In a B2C model, I would assume the Lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk. But, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. Again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.

You can't enact either approach if your masters fire you though.

The investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand's equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.

Oddly, in my perception, Audi took the Lexus approach (sort of), but I could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell Audi after the 60-Minutes story, FORCED Audi to discount their cars just to remain relevant in the US (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the Audi 5000 (which became the A6) linup. The approach would seem to be that the MSRP was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.

So Cadillac is taking the approach of selling cars that are priced higher -- the Sony approach to market share, sort of.

Of course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing. The dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.

We'll see."

Those all are too small differentials. They should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at BMW or Benz, there is still a healthy distance to the STICKER of the Cady. At least for now. The CTS-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep. The sticker shock from previous year was simply too big. There is a history showing such big moves never work. You can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years. Lexus knew it and where are they now. Even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the Germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models. They have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower.

Back in January, Cadillac cut the MSRP on the CTS anywhere from $1-3,000."
3674,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Configuring a, for example, 5 series with X,Y & Z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a CTS is a good way to determine if Cadillac is going after the land grab.

I have no wish for Cadillac to emulate my historical perspective of Sony's playbook. I observed some evidence that was the approach that seemed to materialize coincidental with the birth of the current CTS.

For the most part, I would say I favor the Lexus LS400 approach -- build a comparable car (comparable to Mercedes is the popular conception) and price it so compellingly that it is difficult for customers NOT to shop it.

In some respects, it appears KIA has set its sights on the Premium (including entry-level premium) Class and is using the land grab approach. It's sibling company coming out with the Equus, too, seems like a similar approach. Don't know how it's going with the Equus as it, unlike Lexus, doesn't have a dedicated dealer body. That worked out well for the Phaeton in the US, eh?

My board is always after me to raise the prices of our software products -- doing so, we experienced growth -- slow growth. We changed the strategy to buy one, get one and sales (revenue) literally doubled. Of course my business is B2B, but in the end, the purchases are made by a human, in either a commercial or retail setting, so I assume there is some carry over.

If you want to build market share, go land grab and raise prices slowly over time. If you want to build gross margin -- PER TRANSACTION -- raise the price, but remember the risk is that revenue will likely drop for some period of time (years, in some cases).

The economic reality seems, for cars -- unless you're Lambo or Porsche, or another already high-priced established product, etc -- to favor land grab, if you're trying to build or, in Cadillac's place, re-build a brand.

I think, in part, BMW has mastered this -- they have created an aspirational brand. Everywhere you turn (we have two BMW dealers in Cincinnati who seem to churn out a couple hundred new BMW owners every month) you see ""yourself"" in [generally speaking] a new 3-series; then, when you've finally ""arrived"" you immediately go to the BMW Store or Sweeny and pick up your new symbol of success.

A few years ago, I read an article that said ""Everyone wants to be BMW;"" last year, if you can believe Car & Driver, et al, the headline was ""Everyone wants to be Audi."" Of course the ""Everyone"" was speaking of Audi or BMW's rivals du jour.

Hopefully Cadillac will keep improving the product and will figure out someway to make the cars be perceived as ""worth the asking price.""

Tick-tock."
3675,dino001,August 2015,"Lexus worked, because it was a separate brand. If Hyundai went as far as creating a new brand with separate dealer network, the land grab could work. Selling 70K limousine next to 15K econobox is actually a very difficult proposition. However, the former requires lots of time, resources and patience. The latter can be tried and abandoned in one cycle.

As someone who worked at Sony during the heyday, the writing was on the wall when I left in 97, every segment Sony was in, they had the top model, but when the walkman died, so did a lot of other products, Thier laptop's had many problems and durability was a problem, Sony wouldn't give up on the DAT player for Car Audio or BETA video recorder, two complete failures. Then Sony cheapened the brand by out sourcing products to be manufacturers in Mexico, other brands were getting better and Sony's products were getting outdated and finally other brands surpassed Sony in sales. If it wasn't for the PlayStation, I really think Sony would be a completely different company then it is today."
3678,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Technically the Macan shares about 33% of its DNA with the Audi Q5/SQ5. The two local Audi retailers happen to own Porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping SQ5's with the base Macan. Apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the Audi markings on frame members of the Macan.

Of course my Audi rep thinks the Macan costs $10-$15K more than an SQ5, and has made a Sticker Comparison to demonstrate that.

Frankly, having driven both of them, my take is that for once the Audi interior is second to the Macan's and the Macan has noticeably lower ground clearance. From a power perspective, the Audi has both more HP and torque, but the Porsche's torque, derived as it is from turbo charging comes on at a lower RPM.

The SQ5, were it to offer the German Market lowered suspension (which it does not, here in the US), seems to be more car for the money -- but, ahem, what price the Porsche medallion? The Porsche uses a 7-speed dual clutch unit and the SQ5 uses an 8-speed tiptronic with software that does a pretty good impression of a dual clutch feel.

Lots of options available on the Macan -- and those options can crank a Macan over $100,000. Our lowly SQ5 Prestige with a couple of options and in Panther Black with red leather seats came in at $65,000.

Despite the similarities, there are obvious Porsche touches that are included in that 67% uniqueness -- and while you may argue their value-prop, they certainly do imbue the Macan with Porsche-ness; and, no amount of leather or paint will make the SQ5 a Porsche.

You may cross shop them and I'm certain the country-club valet will give either car you hop out of nothing other than a ton of respect (and will likely avert his eyes), but one, after all is a friggin' Porsche.

Drive it like you live.

NB: My wife decided the SQ5 would be a repeat, primarily because she likes being a bit higher off the ground and because the back seat of the Macan takes a big hit in headroom and cargo space in exchange for having a swoopy rear-end. The Audi, then, gets a nod toward ""practicality"" if you can imagine hauling groceries in a $65,000 Supercharged 354HP 346 ft/lb Torque ""CUV Hot-rod!"""

He also said dealers will be measured on how well they accomplish those last two objectives. Cadillac has 928 dealers in the U.S. who sold 165,000 vehicles last year, compared with 282 Audi dealers who sold 182,000 cars, or less than one-third as many dealers.

A Day in the Life

Due to our on-again, off-again “hobby” – getting educated about a somewhat eclectic number of automotive brands – my wife and I have had the experience of visiting dealerships and interacting with many current auto models and their sales representatives. Included in this list: Jeep, Chrysler, GMC and, of course, Cadillac. Of course we’ve also experienced Acura, Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvo, too. But, in response to DeNysschen’s “warning” to GM’s top brass, I can now reflect on what seems to be a different “approach” prospective customers will enjoy when shopping at the dealership of, apparently most, American automotive brands.

Have you ever heard of or seen a TV show called “WKRP in Cincinnati?” If so, you will have a somewhat more well-rounded perspective of the Herb Tarlek approach. I want to make sure you understand my remarks are a caricature – an exaggeration. You see, Mr. Tarlek is the sales manager of the fictional Cincinnati radio station WKRP – and he is, well, terrible. His behavior qualifies him to be called either a jerk or a jackass. His behavior and customer’s interactions with him often seem vaguely slimy, borderline unethical and disreputable. Further, it appears that Mr. Tarlek has a problem with women, often calling them “hon’” and usually ignoring them altogether, if they are with a man.

Pulling into the lot of [even] a Cadillac dealership, the gentleman sporting a white belt and white shoes barely allows customers to exit their vehicles before invading their personal space and asking them if their “time-frame” is today (since he’s already below his quota and needs to only spend time with customers who will sign and drive NOW.)

Then, you are guided to – apparently – the vehicle with the spiffs on it and “encouraged” to take a test drive. You are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance. Then, the rep gets into the back seat in order to answer any questions that may arise during the test drive.

And so it goes – you can’t wait to get out of there, for, during the test drive the chatter from the back seat is incessant, pressing you for “what’ll it take” to get you to close the deal today.

Come to think of it, this isn’t as much of a caricature as I had intended.

I don’t know if these dealer reps ever shop for cars anywhere else to “see how it is done elsewhere,” but the evidence suggests this is not the case.

On top of way too many dealers, DeNysschen has his work cut out for him – I suspect he’ll be incredibly popular with the dealers (uh huh).

Unless I knew exactly what I wanted and could pretty much handle the entire transaction over the Internet, I don’t know why folks willing and able to plunk down sums often way north of $50,000 put up with this kind of behavior – oh wait, apparently not enough of them do.

Swallow your pride and see if there’s any openings at Audi, Mr. DeNysschen. Cadillac may just be, if not a lost cause, in possession of too much inertia."
3688,wayne21,August 2015,"You are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance.

The reason dealerships want a copy of your driver's license is so they run a credit check on you."
3689,qbrozen,August 2015,"No. Credit check can't be pulled from your DL number. They want to make sure you have a valid DL, first of all, before letting you drive their car on their insurance. They also want ID in case you run off with their car. Seems pretty reasonable.
Fairly steady: '08 Charger R/T Daytona; '67 Coronet R/T; '13 Fiat 500c, '21 WRX, '20 S90 T6, '22 MB Sprinter 2500 4x4 diesel, '97 Suzuki R Wagon; '96 Opel Astra; '08 Maser QP / Rotating stock, but currently: '92 325i, '97 Alto Works, '11 Mini Cooper S"
3690,markcincinnati,August 2015,"The premium car dealerships (we've visited) rarely ask for documentation prior to a test drive -- I dunno, maybe they size up the customer based on the car they drive in. Also, arriving as a couple probably doesn't hurt either.

Running a credit check from your DL? My SSN is NOT on my DL. I suspect there may be other ways to do this, but, one more thing: if a credit check is run through one of the three commercial CB's, there is an ""inquiry"" posted to the formula used to determine your score. Should you have a credit check or worse, multiple credit checks, there is the distinct possibility of a hit (negative) on your scores.

Applying for a credit check -- especially without your knowledge would not be a good practice.

Please note, my comments were meant to suggest a fundamental difference between the experience we customers face at a Premium European or Japanese vs even a Premium American brand.

Actually, since the Cadillac dealer we frequent is next to the Audi dealer where we buy regularly, we are usually just given the keys with the comment, ""take your time.""

The overall spirit of what I was commenting about was to underscore DeNysschen's comments. Really, I am pulling for him and for Cadillac. Sometimes, though, it must seem almost like a lost cause. If he can survive, I would assume he could make Cadillac thrive. It's a long row to hoe, however."

I don't think it's the guy's ego problem. If anything, it's GM's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. They guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. He may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. The problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. In essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change. Simple declaring bankruptcy, shedding assets and contracts is just a start, not the end of restructuring. Cadillac has a network to sell million cars a year and the product that sells less than half of that with sales are barely moving up in the aggregate, falling in key segments. Essentially a burning platform, to use Elop's language about Nokia. I unfortunately think they may end up like Nokia, too. Perhaps it will take longer.

$5K is a lot of work for someone not to be able to notice it on a test drive. You can hide some sins in a car. But, $5K worth should be relatively noticeable.

The problem is that those dealers kind of deserve it (at least some), as they don't reflect what Cadillac should be and there is not even a chance they'll ever do.

I don't think it's the guy's ego problem. If anything, it's GM's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. They guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. He may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. The problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. In essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change. Simple declaring bankruptcy, shedding assets and contracts is just a start, not the end of restructuring. Cadillac has a network to sell million cars a year and the product that sells less than half of that with sales are barely moving up in the aggregate, falling in key segments. Essentially a burning platform, to use Elop's language about Nokia. I unfortunately think they may end up like Nokia, too. Perhaps it will take longer.
So Johan de NoclueaboutCaddysschen seems to be saying that Cadillacs should be selling for more than the equivalent BMWs, Audis, or MBs.

?

That is not going to happen. The buyers of those cars are loyal and dedicated, and very few of them will ever consider a Cadillac—especially if it costs more money.

I'm trying to figure this out, but I see from GM's webpage (and even though he's spending their money hand over fist on his experiment, he's at the same time trying to distance himself from them?) that he grew up in South Africa. He also, as we know, worked for a long time for Audi, and then for Infiniti.

http://www.gm.com/content/gmcom/home/company/aboutGM/GM_Corporate_Officers/johan_nysschen.html

Essentially, Johan de N. doesn't seem to have much of a clue about who buys Cadillacs. The Cadillac buyer wants American luxury, performance, and style—but not at a nosebleed price. They either won't pay that much—or can't.

Cadillac has already moved upmarket in the last 15 years. And that's a good thing. But these new moves don't seem rational to me or to some other people.

For instance, would Audi owner markcincinnati be willing to pay *more* than an Audi for a Cadillac? I don't think so.

And now Johan de Nosebleedprysschen is insulting his own dealer network.

?

Bet the dislike for him at the grassroots dealer level is swelling like a Fukushima tsunami....

Hire an outside ""genuis"" for megabucks who promises you the moon? But then he blows up the brand on the launchpad. Seems like a classic corporate mistake.

Had the car for 6 months -- has 103K miles on it (how many did it have 6 months ago)? What was paid for the car 6-months ago (was it picked up below retail market? If so, how much below retail market)? Let's just say it was picked up from a private individual ""as is"" and was offered up at $2K below retail market -- that would suggest a still healthy but less so investment of ""only"" $3K in repairs vs what could have been, should have been, etc.

Are we counting such things as ""tires, brake pads, struts, rotors, cabin-filters, wheel-alignment and wiper blades"" as repairs? The last time I had to pay for a cabin filter it was a multi-hundred dollar affair, all in.

Is this car this person's first BMW or first high-mileage European car? My neighbor with 80,000 miles on a Pontiac (don't know the age), said the car was a money vacuum, in that it sucked all his money out of his checkbook. Most folks, these days are WARY of buying high-mileage cars that are breathtakingly expensive to repair and maintain.

And: How many times have we here said European cars are breathtakingly expensive to own out of warranty? Answer, about 139,659 times on this forum alone. Of course, you can be forgiven if you didn't read this board backwards to 2002. Really, we'll let that pass.

Key question, was a full, complete, total, non-free inspection performed on the car prior to purchase; if so what did the inspection reveal -- you would think such an inspection would've picked up something that would have caused it to burn through $5K worth of ""repairs"" (see maintenance comment above), perhaps?

Whenever anyone I know asks me for my advice or opinion regarding a used-car purchase, I typically urge them to spend the money for a non-biased, not-free inspection from a specialist enterprise. Here in RiverCity, there are several BMW or German or European repair houses (not dealer affiliated) who for a 3-figure number will put together a report on the used car you are lusting for, outlining the expected near term costs of ownership.

I always seem to get someone here upset at me when I suggest it is often far cheaper (on a 12, 24, 36 or even 48 month basis) to lease a brand new, with warranty (and often maintenance-included) car than it is to buy a used one with the potential of requiring huge sums of money just to keep it running.

What would a 2007 335i go for? Locally a new 3-series can be leased often for a number beginning with a 3. Often Accords can be had for even less, try $219/mo for a strippie for 27 months.

And (if it is a BMW) that mo/pmt includes the maintenance and free (well, you know) repairs for 50,000 miles. It seems to me to be hard to compete with these sub-vented leases, unless for some reason you think you are making an ""investment"" in a declining-value asset -- and even with BMW's that's a hard argument to win.

Going to an Accord, per se, is not a bad thing or a dumb thing to do -- in fact, such a move may very well be a good and smart thing to do; but unless the Accord in question is 100% new with factory warranty and any mntce program that may accompany it, the same rule of thumb would apply -- get the damn thing rigorously inspected before buying/leasing/financing/acquiring.

Some of us are ""types."" After dozes of German cars, my wife and I each went with Infiniti [her] and Acura [me]; we liked the cars for the most part, but it was really quite difficult to build up much passion or, actually, any emotion. My cousin, ""Mr. Honda or Mr. Mazda and now Mr. KIA,"" tried out a German and, although it was no trouble, he just seemed to resent (?) the fact that he had to interact with the car -- he just couldn't get into the ""don't forget to breathe"" tag line sign hanging low and large at the local BMW dealership.

Maybe it is telling -- I am not certain ""what"" it is telling, however -- that the BMW's ouster will be followed not by another German or European or even Premium car, but by a Honda Accord. Again, there is nothing wrong with Accord's, but I would typically think folks who like BMW's unlikely to shop Honda's. Were I in the same situation, I would likely be looking to get right back on the horse and, if possible, get a younger -- or new -- BMW."

This is a good discussion.

I am currently in a lease of a pedestrian vehicle (Hyundai Elantra GT) that expires in about 15 months. Lately, I've been toying with the idea of getting a few-years-old Infiniti (G25x or G37x) as my next car and wonder about maintenance costs. I have a friend in CA with a J30 that has over 200,000 miles on it; he uses an independent shop for most maintenance. He only used the dealer once - to change the timing belt.

2015 Subaru Outback 3.6R / 2014 MINI Countryman S ALL4"
3704,markcincinnati,August 2015,"2007 BMW 335i Coupe 100,574 miles: asking $13,995 (market value = $14,031 according to cargurus.com)

w/58,000 miles on the OD: asking $19,995 (market value = $17,877 according to cargurus.com)

Let's say the car was $13,000, then add $5,000 for whatever it took to keep the thing running. $18,000 or $500 per month if you could get 0.0% financing for 36 months, plus gas, plates and insurance. If you paid $13,000 that is still $361 per month (w/o warranty or maintenance) for 36 months, plus gas, plates. . .etc.

New, x-drive 3-series 2015 BMW's @36 months going for $299/mo. Includes mntce, doesn't include gas, plates and insurance. Full disclosure, before any negotiation, up front (cap cost reduction) cash = $3,000; this can be negotiated either in the discount off MSRP or other incentives that are offered from time-to-time.

There is no free-lunch (well, there is a free-lunch tomorrow, according to the sign.) I crack myself up.

I would think the new car would have a lower risk and very high expectation of having lower operating costs than a 2007 model with 100K+ miles on it.

Of course, we really don't have enough information to call the two transactions high vs low risk, for perhaps the 2007 was acquired for $3,000 cash, not $13,000 -- the ire of the poster however would seem to suggest that an impossibly low selling price was not part of the picture of this transaction some 6 months ago."

3708,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Michaell - despite my previous declaration that neither my wife nor I found the Infiniti (or Acura) particularly emotionally engaging, I will add to my above urging to get a full inspection (that you PAY for) the following:

The Q40, if it is the one I think it is, will be the ""Japanese BMW"" if you care about my perspective; it will be quite the performer, very engaging to drive.

Moreover, based on our experience, Infiniti knows how to build a reliable and -- I would extrapolate -- durable car. However, it is a premium car and if it does need repairs, out of warranty they won't be cheap (maintenance, however, will probably cost less for an Infiniti than for a BMW or Audi, for example). At 39 months, however, I would probably have very very low concern, especially if I planned to do 39 months and move onto the next.

Whatever you do, should you go previously owned, get the thing inspected and do yourself a favor, shop the used car against a new one if monthly payment and TOC (total operating costs) are of concern -- then after you have the data, make your move."

Yep. I'll say that all of those things (expendables) should be pretty obvious in their lack of replacement/repair with a relatively quick test drive and a quick look under the chasis and under the hood.

3715,markcincinnati,August 2015,"You Never Close Your Eyes . . .

To many – perhaps most – of us born in the ‘50’s, it is difficult to comprehend or even imagine the apparent blasé attitude of many Americans, most of them born after the ‘70’s or ‘80’s (apparently), toward cars. I work with 30, 40 & 50-somethings. Only those seeing, or soon seeing their 5th decade seem to have much, if any, interest in cars. One gentleman loves his Mini; and is a pretty ardent participant in local and even some national Mini events.

Getting him started on what he did last weekend surely invites him to share the pictures from the most recent cross-country Mini event or gathering. He has a map over his desk outlining a coast-to-coast Mini drive, and it is easy to find him gazing – longingly – at that map from time-to-time. Other than that, these “youngsters” seem to care less about what “my peeps” hold dear: Fine cars, fine dining, fine wine and home theaters that require a minimum of a 70” screen.

These “yutes” seem mildly, or politely, interested in “my generation’s” escapades, but there is virtually no-one left on the planet who seems to know or care much about cars – far as I know, I’m the only subscriber to any auto-enthusiast magazines; no really, I’m the last one, anywhere.

One of the mid-fifty-ish folks I know recently traded in his stick-shift Acura TL for a used RDX (really incredibly low mileage). He had, at least, taken the time to research his purchase, remarking about the SH-AWD and the turbo charged engine (and he loves the DVD-Audio sound system). But, beyond his own vehicle, beyond the Acura brand, he neither knows nor cares.

My nephew, a twenty-something wrapping up his undergraduate degree (part time) while working (full time), certainly has the means to drive something that could get his adrenaline pumping, but he has a Saturn – and I don’t think it has been washed anytime in the 21st century, leading me to conclude he cares not at all for cars (his at least).

OK, so I can find almost no-one interested in discussing the “Performance Sedan” (ELLPS and/or LPS) class. Must be that when I was growing up the automobile was the symbol of freedom, fun and somewhat even a symbol of a certain status (thinking of V8 vs 6, “SS” vs Biscayne, etc.). Thin red-striped sidewall tires, “Wide-Oval” rubber and Hurst Shifters in your newly acquired Goat ruled my formative years. I couldn’t wait to get my temps, my license and ultimately my own car, a 1963 lime-green Chrysler Newport. I ran the thing without an air-cleaner and pulled the hub-caps (remember those?) and shined the matte black paint on the wheels with STP and Pledge (as I recall, I did this ritual daily – at least during the good months of the year).

Today, our office manager a late-30’s woman, cares about cars perhaps on-par with dishwashing machines and dual-fuel ranges; no wait, dual-fuel ranges rule, especially if they come from Kitchen Aid or Jenn-Air.

Today’s youth, consisting, in part, of tomorrow’s Premium Class buyers look at cars almost as a necessary evil or, at best, a four-wheel appliance – seemingly the more sterile and passionless the better.

It seems to me that cars must no longer symbolize freedom, rather they suggest you're “joining a group” [under duress] – these post-baby boomers somehow “lost that lovin’ feelin’” so many of us embraced then and, without being too sentimental, come close to cherishing today.

I recall my sophomore year at college – I had met the girl. She lived in Florida, I in Ohio, and I just couldn’t imagine how we could spend Thanksgiving break apart, so I filled up the ol’ ’63 Newport and made the drive – virtually non-stop – from Oxford, Ohio to Naples, Florida. It is a wonder I didn’t kill myself, I got so sleepy.

The point is, the car granted me both the ability and freedom to choose to make the moronic decision to drive, almost literally, down and back over a three-day period (and, since I needed gas money, I had to sleep in the damn car, unable to afford a place to stay). I loved it.

“Kids” today don’t take “road trips,” don’t yell “shot-gun” and don’t know that a ’63 Newport had the 361 CI V8, while the 300 and the New Yorker had a 383 and a 413 respectively. Clarification, I would not expect a 20-year old today to know much, if anything about a 1963 vintage automobile; my point is these youngin’s don’t know what 335i, 328i, quattro, SH-AWD, 4-Motion, Tip-tronic or even ABS means. I assume they know the name BMW, Cadillac and Ferrari, however – I hope they do, anyway.

Automobile manufacturers have a lot of research, development and marketing to do if they want to return to their former selves, in terms of being Objets de Desír.

Just as one example. There is a seriously significant ""cult"" of young people who spend big bucks on VW Camper Vans and who travel in packs around the country. They'll drop $35K on a VW Synchro Camper but never on a performance sedan. These aren't hippies, they are working families and often professionals."
3717,robr2,August 2015,"mark - I have to agree. I would have to say that most under 30 have no interest in automobiles. As hard as I tried, my 18 YO could care less about cars.

You mentioned the freedom that your 93 Newport gave you. I too felt that my 72 Cutlass gave me freedom. But we grew up in a much smaller world. Cases in point:

Before I had a grown up job, I had been on one plane trip. I can't count the number of times my kids have been on plane trips. My 15 YO daughter is going on 3 of them in the next 12 months and none of them is with family.

We had 3 channels on TV - if your family was rich and had UHF TV, you might have 5.

We had one avocado green rotary phone in the kitchen and we didn't make long distance calls. I remember my parents calling the operator to schedule a time for an overseas line to call family for a few expensive minutes of conversation.

On Sundays we went to church then went to our cousin's house for a late lunch and a day of fun or the beach for an all day outing involving lots of water, sand, and sunburns.

We would go on vacation to the beach two hours away and know nothing of what was going on at home.

Kids today - I can't believe I just said that - have the world at the fingertips and that is their freedom. The don't need a car to take them away.

It's not necessarily a bad thing. We can lament the interest in automobiles but there are so many more choices available to people."

Currently he likes the M3/4, Cayman S, GT350, STI, and the Hellcat Challenger- as well as some true exotics. He has had a lot of exposure to the performance side, hanging out at O'fest with me and shagging rides in fairly quick cars such as a B7 press loaner and a GT2 RS.

3722,markcincinnati,August 2015,"breld: My S4 is a mechanical device and, like all such devices, isn't perfect. Having said that, I am now north of 32,000 miles and, other than springing perhaps a little early for new tires, have nothing negative to report with respect to reliability, drive-ability, performance or efficiency.

I ordered mine with A/S tires, which does set the top speed limit (which can be changed with a keystroke or two) to 130MPH. Mine is a Premium+ model (DSG 7-speed transmission) with MMI/Navigation Plus, Audi-side assist, full leather [no alcantara inserts] seats (in red), B&O sound system/speakers, Audi-care and Carbon Fiber interior trim. It, with shipping, came to ~$57K; and I paid 94% of sticker (member of the Audi Club of NA, discount of 6%).

At my own option, I have doubled the # of oil changes (I go in every 5,000 miles, meaning I pay for every-other oil change.) I have had the car mini detailed twice and a full-on inside and outside detail once (in the 22 or 23 months since I got it). I swapped the OE tires for Conti's Extreme Contact DWS/06's a couple thousand miles ago and the handling took a very big step up and road noise, already low, dropped even further.

I would get another one -- without any question (assuming the price doesn't shoot up like Cadillac did to the CTS line). I see no reason NOT to keep it until at least 90,000+ miles (based on its complete lack of any issues, thus far.)

I have no clue if these cars hold their value better than or worse than whatever they might be shopped against -- my sense is at $57K, I would have had to take a lesser-contented BMW 335i x-drive. We've had 3 BMW's and this Audi feels more powerful than any i6 BMW we've had, but since the Audi is supercharged, this may not be a fair comparison.

I wish the back seat had at least 1"" additional leg room, but since my 22 pound Sheltie is usually the only rear seat passenger, it is not really a show stopper; besides the next gen ""A4/S4"" family will grow in size somewhat, so, again, if I knew then what I know now, I would, without hesitation repeat the acquisition of an S4.

My complaints -- ONE; the car came with WiFi based on T-Mobile 3G technology. If I actually could find and keep a 3G signal (instead, mine is mostly at 2G), I would be fine with the WiFi performance. Ultimately, my dealer showed me a secret method of adapting the carrier from T-Mobile to AT&T with some software coding and a new SIMM chip -- I am now, always in 3G. I read somewhere that the 2016 A4/S4's will offer 4G LTE radios, solving the T-Mobile (in our geography) performance issues.

Love the feature of being able to Google a destination by voice and having the sat nav take you there -- all hands free.

Love the instant response of the power, the 7-speed DSG and the tuneage from the B&O speakers.

Regrets? Wish I had gone the extra $1,000 for the Sport Differential (Audi's name for torque vectoring).

After driving an S4, you will -- upon sliding behind the wheel of almost any other car -- wonder if the different car than the S4 is, somehow, broke. The 3.0T motor is damn near electric in feel as it whisks you effortlessly from 0 to 60, just about the time you reach the end of your . . . driveway. Ruh Roh!

Hope this helps.

P.S. I am not too much of a believer that ""new models"" are prone to first-year glitches; I am a believer, however, that often the last year of a model's life-cycle provides the least amount of problems, often the greatest amount of content for the dollars spent and a pretty good chance of a deeper discount since there are no secrets. In other words, there will be a new, B9, A4/S4 model -- MY 2017. The 2016's, therefore will have to have more content and a better deal in order to help dealers clear out the ""old"" inventory thus making room for the new. Audi, I believe, has taken to delaying the availability of the new model until a certain threshold of sales of the old model has passed, therefore providing some ""value support"" both for the dealers and ultimately, of course, the buyers.

Discounts will be there for 2016 A4/S4's -- but don't expect to see a $58,000 S4 for $48K just because there is a new 2017 in the pipeline."

2015 Subaru Outback 3.6R / 2014 MINI Countryman S ALL4"
3730,circlew,August 2015,"Subaru has 4 different AWD setups but they have fundamental similarities. The boxer setup allows for a center mounted trans eliminating uneven axles to create a balanced system for each side of the car, eliminating torque steer. They also have a 50/50 (or very close to it) depending on the system that is being used (Torsen based), where as other systems are fwd cars that send small amounts of power to the rear wheels if needed (Haldex based).
With Audi, they have two different kinds of setups, one being Haldex based the other being Torsen based. It depends on which type of motor being used in the car if it is the inline four in the 2.0T or a VR6 configuration like the 3.2 or 2.8 cars it's a Haldex based system, if it uses a true V6 or a V8 then it gets the Torsen based system and is rear biased in power split.
Most companies use the Haldex based AWD i.e. Toyota, Honda, Ford, etc. That system is not as effective since it doesn't have as much power going to each wheel when it needs it. If you are driving on ice, or snow, or in the rain it helps to have the power going to those wheels, with Subaru you have the car shifting around power as well, creating a system that is unmatched by most systems, Audi is in a close second with its Quattro system when using the Torsen system."

What he said with exception of CVT and old 4AT Subarus used 90/10 split, 5AT six cylinder engines had 45/55 split, I think.  Don't know today.  Manual Subies had 50/50 with STI extra feature of driver-controlled bias adjustment, I think it was +/- 20.  Audi's setup was also dictated by engine position - transverse had Haldex AWD, longitudinal had Torsen, as a rule of thumb.

I'd agree on the more car for the money, at least for now. A 428xi GC equipped as I'd like it (and comparable in features to the S4) is about the same money as the S4.

I had the previous gen 335xi (E90) and probably miss that car more than any other in recent ownership, other than perhaps the tight rear seat. I think my affinity for the S4 harkens back to the feel of that car.

3734,markcincinnati,August 2015,"I had a 2005 A6 3.2 -- it was TorSen. As far as I know, all [quattro] Audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a TorSen system, not Haldex. Audi TT's and some A3 models (and VW golfs) had east west engines and utilized Haldex mechanisms.

Early Audis with the TorSen system were 50 50 torque split, Haldex systems were typically 90 10 (F R) splits.

In the US, at least, almost all Audis sold for the past couple of decades have been quattros and almost all of them have been TorSen, culminating in the cars using TorSen having a REAR biased AWD design. The sport differential (rear only) further enabled Audis so equipped to mitigate the understeer prevalent in cars (like Audis) with their engines ahead of the front axle.

TorSen AWD systems have many positives but at the cost of added weight.

Currently Audi continues to balance the weight of many of its cars to be less nose heavy than in the past.

As far as I know, TorSen AWD systems are the only systems that ""bind in real time"" -- meaning they do not react, they just act -- essentially eliminating the torque shift lag time of other reactive systems.

In day to day use, I have to wonder, however, if most of us mere mortals can actually tell the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical (rear biased) systems -- although I do believe it is quite possible to tell you're driving an essentially FWD car that happens to be able to shift power aft (Acura and Volvo spring to mind).

Even so, an Acura TLX with SH-AWD can do a pretty good imitation of an S4 much of the time -- in the clutch, so to speak, however, the FWD biased systems often still feel more FWD than AWD to me.

OK, how 'bout this: ""Audi certainly has its fans and foes, but those in both camps agree, if you're looking for an AWD premium luxury performance sedan, the short list has Audi atop it!""

I assume the possibility and perhaps the probability that Porsche and Lambo may ""do awd better than Audi"" but the thing is, even these two super-car brands are all part of the same family. The Lambo system appears to be in a leadership position what with electronic control of all three differentials.

But, my ""assertion"" was in the context of the LPS and ELLPS world we rage on about here on this forum.

Techie in nature:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkd9B1wx540

More entertaining and a bit of a history lesson:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z19953Dy_SA

Here is another assertion, but this one is not based on any experience or real study of the brand:

In the class of cars (""economy car"", according to Car & Driver) Subaru typically is placed, Subaru does AWD better than any of its competitors. My only reason for such a conclusion is that Subaru has demonstrated its almost fanatical dedication to AWD and, over the years, at least one of its cars, the WRX, has been praised as the Japanese S4.

The differences and similarities are discussed and dissected here in this comparison of a 2015 WRX to a 2010 S4.

New vs. Old:

http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/new-vs-old-2015-subaru-wrx-vs-2010-audi-s4-comparison-test

Now for the fine print: Today, as a practical matter, several [many?] companies manufacture and market great AWD cars. It is also true that Audi has been doing this for decades (in some cases decades longer than other's in its class), meaning others have been at this nowhere near as long.

Yet technology has progressed sufficiently that the market may not perceive anything more than subtle differences between Audi's, BMW's, Lexus', Volvo's or Subaru's approach to AWD; but those who make their living knowing about the differences and the subtleties, regularly praise Audi's approach as very significant and often superior. Of course, in all fairness, many of the enthusiast magazines and their editors and staff now spend more ink describing the overall performance of the cars they review than they do on describing and detailing how one AWD choice differs, is better or worse, than another.

Often wrong, but never uncertain, I say: ""Nobody does AWD better than Audi."""
3739,Mr_Shiftright,August 2015,"if you don't have the right tires, even with 8-wheel drive you aren't going anywhere."
3740,dino001,August 2015,"Mark, if anything, the link proves that Subaru could be argued as a winner. It holds its own against motor with extra 65 hp and two cylinders. It cost 20 grand less in total ownership, even though 2010 S4 has already depreciated a good deal (essentially S4 still is more and anticicapted repairs kill it in this category). Yes, it is also nicer, but I don't see unquestionned superiority. And this is still the pedestrian WRX, not STI, which you can get for that price purchase difference of 5 grand or so. Extra stuff, better AWD. I know, Audi has RS4, but adjusted for the money, Subaru does it better. Engineering has always been a game of optimizing the variables to bring the value. Take WRX against A4/A5 2.0, see who wins. And WRX still costs less. Even STI may cost less than A4/A5.

It's easy to deliver a monster nobody can afford. Got extra 20 grand, get S4, got extra 40 grand, get RS4, when available, wanna keep the money, get Subaru.

Prototypes are now being made, but the NSX won't be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. Auto Blog as some tidbits they've gotten from the engineers and builders of the NSX, which is being built in Ohio:

http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/15/acura-nsx-cosworth-engine-block-details/

""Acura NSX will use Cosworth block, plus other neat tidbits


The blue NSX you see here was built just two weeks ago. Prototype number six, it rolled off Acura's newest assembly line in Ohio and was rushed out to the Monterey peninsula for various car week activities. We had a chance to sit down with several members of the NSX team to discuss the car, the long road from concept to production, and some interesting details. Below are some choice bits from our conversations.

Acura is pretty proud of the fact that NSX version 2.0 was designed and is being built in the US. The new assembly line, called the Performance Manufacturing Center, is in Honda's hometown of Marysville, Ohio. While the line is brand new, the building has seen many uses over its lifetime, most recently as a warehouse facility. PMC staff numbers about 100, with 60 technical and 40 non-technical associates.

The car uses parts sourced globally, and one of those sources is Cosworth. The engine blocks and heads come from the English firm and get assembled into twin-turbo powerhouses at Honda's nearby Anna, Ohio, engine plant. The Cosworth name is rarely associated with a bad engine, so we were geeked to hear the NSX's 550-plus-horsepower hybrid powertrain has good genes....

....the NSX buyer will get to make lots of decisions to craft a custom order. Choices will include paint, interior hues, several wheel styles and finishes, and additional carbon-fiber parts and trim; the standard car will have an aluminum roof, while a carbon piece can be spec'd, and available carbon dress-up pieces will include side sills, a rear diffuser, and an engine dress-up kit.
The newly announced blue paint, called Nouvelle Blue Pearl, like the red used on the 2015 show car, uses a fancy multi-layer paint process from PPG that does a nice job of highlighting the surfacing and creases in the car's body. It gave the production engineers a headache, however, since it takes about 16 hours to cure versus regular paint's two-hour wait time. Not surprisingly, it will be an extra-cost option.""

3748,markcincinnati,August 2015,"At this point, as I said, most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most AWD systems, regardless of MSRP. I do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many AWD systems -- unless they are of the FWD power biased flavor (my TL SH-AWD was FWD biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my Audis do not exhibit).

Today, Subarus no matter what their content or technology are not in the Premium Class. For all I know they do have Audi AWD chops and are $20K or $40K less. Even the C&D comparo ended with the conclusion that the author(s) would take a 2010 S4 over a new WRX. I read their words, I do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed (and possibly biased or unbiased) comment on the matter.

I would, initially, expect a $60K car to be in some ways superior to a $30 or $40K car, content, styling, performance, the whole package-wise. This would not be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle.

For the moeny, were I to be given a Subaru budget, I would NOT opt for the 5-year old Audi -- I would indeed go with something NEW (very possibly the Subaru).

My experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted S4-like performance for less money, to look seriously at an Acura TLX SH-AWD (Advance). If the Premium Car experience was unimportant to this someone, I would certainly suggest they shop Subaru, especially if one of their criteria was having AWD.

I have, very recently, read some reviews of the Nissan Maxima Platinum version -- while not a member of the Premium Class (as defined by someone, somewhere), this new Maxima certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ELLPS -- although Infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ.

Most of what I seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise Audi's TorSen based quattro system as ""one of the best"" or sometimes even the best AWD systems currently on the market.

That Subaru's system may be right up there is something I shall surely remember when I come across such commentary or test reports. Mean time, since we're not speaking/discussing, HERE of either Lambo's or Subbie's systems, I suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks: AWD vs 2WD -- my position is that AWD is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on. I would postulate that one of the hallmarks required for sustainable success in the market is / are four driven wheels."

Agree completely. It is too soon to charge that much. And, seems to me there are just too many stories like the following:

Another long-time BMW owner neighbor, had ONE bad experience with his BMW -- the bun warmers caught on fire. Yeah, I know that is a big ""bad"" experience. So, he gets a new CTS. It has been, no lie, at the dealership more than in his driveway.

The thing is, the loaner -- for a time -- was an ATS. He finally said he wanted like-for-like and he now, at least, is driving a loaner CTS. Funny, he has had the loaner so long he washes it and takes IT IN FOR SERVICE.

I don't know about you, but I do wish there was SOMETHING in between an A4 and and A6 or a 3 series and a 5 series. No, no, an A5 or 4 series won't do. The reason I want something that is really in-between is I just want something a little bit bigger (and this is a contradiction -- I know -- I've flip flopped on this more than twice).

I was loaned an A6 3.0T with a sport package. I liked it -- but, even with the sport package it didn't seem to be quite as nimble as I had mis-remembered it would be. Then today, 4 of us from my office went to lunch together -- well the two folks in the back seat of the S4 were ""this close"" to having enough knee room -- another inch back seat space would have been fine -- two inches ample.

I keep holding out hope that the new A4/S4 coming out next year will grow slightly in all directions -- but meantime, the gap between the A4 and A6 is large enough, I think, for there to be something that would fit in between; maybe an A5, gulp, sedan? Or a junior A7.

BTW, drove an S6 again -- love the power, love everything about it, except it is too big (well it would be most of the time) and it gives off so very few ""S"" cues from behind the wheel, it is somewhat disappointing. It performs great -- has gobs of go and stopping power, and it does have an ""S"" suspension from a capability perspective -- but the car is a cocoon. Usually a good thing, but when you pay that much, it would be nice if it had a bit of GRRR to be found. :@

The 3-series GT sort of offers what you speak of, with loads of rear seat legroom on that longer 3-series platform. Whether you like the looks of the vehicle is a different matter.

I'm sure the new A4 next year will offer some sort of increase in size - maybe that will be a sweetspot for you.

3765,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Tire Update

I have a couple thousand miles on my Continental DWS 06 UHP A/S tires.

While very good from mile one and better after mile 150, now at a couple grand miles on the road, I can offer this:

These tires are really UHP tires, they do not, from my perspective here in SW Ohio, need to apologize or explain why they are a compromise shoe. I can think of no attribute of this tire that makes me long for a MAX Perf (summer only) tire instead. I do not track my car. I do not take my car off normal highways, roads and streets. I generally enjoy taking corners and curves as aggressively as possible (given traffic and other safety considerations, of course). When conditions and traffic (and the long arm of the law) permits, I have been known to exceed 100MPH (usually on Interstates where traffic is thin and widely spaced).

I like a tire to be quiet. I do not want ANY tread noise. Not gonna tolerate it.

The handling, braking, ""quietness"", comfort and anything you can think of that describes performance of these tires is (are) exemplary. While not cheap, the tires will not require you to take out a second mortgage, and they should last some 40,000+ miles and still remind you they are (mostly) still UHP tires.

Unless you have no need for cold weather or ""light-snow"" traction, these tires should be given a good look-see and test drive (if possible). I don't want to make this too dramatic, but I cannot think of any tire that I have ever had that exceeds the performance of the DWS 06 Continental Extremes.

I sourced these from Tire Rack; and after they were mounted and road force balanced my S4 was given a 4-wheel alignment.

What drew me to the CTS were the steep discounts, too.....along with the fact that I thought the CTS drove better than a 5 Series, and certainly looked better. Have they priced themselves out of the market? I don't know.

But, at this price range (or any price range, for that matter), people expect a level of service that reflects the price and status of the car. That's where Cadillac really falls down. They may have put a nice product out there, but they can not pretend like customer service is an after thought (as they have with mine, which has spent it's 30th day in the dealer's shop as of today). Further, either they can't, or won't fix it. I think it's a combination of the two. They are trained to read a computer read out of a fix, and that's it. If it doesn't show a code, they view it as ""operating as normal"".

BMW, Jag, Lexus, Mercedes, Acura, Infiniti, etc operate on a level several levels above that type of service.

That's essentially a full overhaul. Add a name change for a good measure. I truly believe they should try do ""a Lexus"", but I doubt they will.

I think they are simply unable to change, first because they think they don't need to (if they did, they'd never put those crazy CTS prices and also priced ATS more in line with Acura/Volvo products, not Benz/BMW). Second, even if they saw a need for change, they are locked into the dealership network that is three times as large as it should be, considering current sales volumes. I'm sure those franchise contracts don't let them walk away at will, there are steep penalties, plus political fallout (imagine those tearful articles of lost jobs in a small town Cadillac dealer).

In essence, what they need to do, they can't and they won't. It's just going to be slow dying, probably very slow (they still sell good deal of Escalades), interrupted by some pretend moves and couple of short resurgences (once in a while they'll have a good month, or quarter), which will only postpone it. As before, a belief in a new ad campaign fixing all their ills will be magical.

I'm not saying you are wrong, necessarily. Just that there are, effectively, 2 classes of luxo cars (IMHO), and Caddy fits in the typically more expensive of those.

I would think if you get enough cars out there AND they are indeed a good and reliable (they can work on durable later) product, well economics 101 -- demand will go up as price drops (IF the reliability is there).

Include all maintenance, of course and improve the dealership experience to Premium Car (European and Japanese) expectations.

Then, assuming all of the above (especially the goodness of the product) comes to pass, THEN allow the sub-venting to erode. As the post above says -- this will be about a 10 year exercise.

I must say, after watching Audi and UNINTENDED acceleration etc, 10 years would be a bargain, if Cadillac could pull it off in that period of time.

You're looking at the content. I'm looking at the brand equity. Cadillac simply doesn't have it. There are only two ways to build it:

a. Killer product, killer service/experience, high price, low volume, niche product, build it up from there; translation - crash in sales, close 75 percent of dealerships, consolidate production, long and painful process, but can be successful, if executed properly. You make lots of money on every unit sold, but don't expect to be on the best seller list. but Call it ""Jaguar option""
b. Killer product, killer service/experience, undercut price - low profits, build brand equity, then start slowly raising it. GM has neither. Requires deep pockets, lots of patience. Call it ""Lexus option"". Patience has never been a virtue of American corporations (especially those publicly traded on Wall Street). Add of course additional issues with memories of bailout, it probably doesn't have the money, either.

So Cadillac chose option c: pretend you can get higher prices on somewhat (arguably a lot) improved product without changing any other aspect of your business.

I've thought about this a lot. Not necessarily the union aspect, as they're a shell of their former self, and wield a lot less power.

Agree Sween. Investors want their investment to grow. That's it. That's all they want.

What bothers me, GM had a clean slate. Debt wiped out. Had an excuse to wipe out whole brands and dealers with little in the way of repurcussions (Oldsmobile, Hummer, Pontiac, etc). They could have become a great company, ONCE AGAIN! They had the opportunity to become good at whatever they chose.

At least in Cadillac's case, they went right back to the same old GM with indifferent quality, buggy technology, subpar customer support, etc.

I rent a lot of cars. I've rented a lot of Chevy Cruz's. On the surface, it's a pretty competitive car. You drive it for a few days and understand one thing.....""were the designers and engineers hamstrung by the accontants, again?"".

I know a lot of times, even with my CTS, I ask myself...""did the builders, designers, engineers really think this through?"" The answer is usually ""NO""! It's like they got part of the way there, and just ran out of time, or ran out of money, or just stopped before what they were doing was fully baked.

circle...you're right. They have become a truck company. Nothing wrong with that. Stick with what you do best. But, to keep trying to convince everyone else they are still a car company...well, that's proved a whole lot more difficult.

3787,dino001,August 2015,"I think the ""old GM"" is in the comeback exactly because that bankruptcy was tainted by politics. Law blatantly disregarded - for those who don't know, stakeholder's payoff order was changed in favor White House political backers (i.e. unions) rather than those who (by law) deserve it most (senior bondholders with secured notes). This basically taught them wrong lesson.

In essence, the process was not painful enough. Bankruptcy is supposed to be painful, as it wipes out those with weak interest (like shareholders, employees) and damages those with stronger interest (debt holders, government). It's an exchange - bondholders stop the imminent execution of the debt and in exchange they receive equity in reorganized company. All of that is overseen by a judge in a process that usually starts as adversarial and ends as cooperative. The plan for the reorganized company needs to be approved by a judge, but the bondholders have ample opportunity to give their input and voice their concerns. NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!! Government came, wiped out those they deemed ""unworthy"" (and used media to vilify them in the process), gave rewards to those who were ""worthy"" (read supported their political cause) and then bullied judicial system to approve the tainted deal. A true disappointment was that the judges did not find enough courage to stop it. I can only guess why.

In this climate, how anybody can make real decisions? Those that can be even more difficult and more painful? There is no way. They changed a few things on the surface, a few more a bit deeper, but then everybody moved on, so the old habits can come back.

Let's stipulate that your observations are accurate. We then need to say that we can't un-ring the bell.

As a practical matter, while your comments would still be accurate they would probably not be made or even too much cared about if what emerged was a ""great"" car from a great car company (isolating Cadillac here).

I went to a friend's birthday party over the weekend -- of course after the dinner, some of the typical male/female behavior emerged with the two genders gathered in two groups catching up and being social. One of the well-wishers apparently was well off enough to have had several Ferrari's and he was remarking how he had never had any car have a $10,000 bill for what he would classify as routine mntce (a new clutch for a manual transmission Ferrari). His beloved Italian had just cost him this much -- ouch!

The conversation about cars was ""on."" In the parking-lot population of a couple of dozen premium cars (from Europe and Asia) there was a lone Cadillac CTS coupe. We all agreed the car was handsome -- the owner added his own comments suggesting that he agreed the car was beautiful to behold but that it had been a lot of trouble and that his [few] Cadillac owning friends had not one satisfied member amongst them.

I'm not sure what all of the ""big"" problems were, but problems seemed to plague just about every system a car has, according to him. The birthday boy (age 60) has a Mercedes V8 coupe (the $125,000 version whatever/whenever that is) and a Sonota with 120K miles on it. He wants a Porsche -- don't know what one -- but he says he can't beat the Sonota for its 100% reliability (and, at 120K miles, I would expect he would add durability, too), so he drives it to the office and saves the Merc for weekends. He also has one of those giant Yukon XL SUV's and a couple of Harley's.

Were I a Cadillac employee or affiliated in any way with Cadillac, this would have been a cringe-worthy event, with folks saying mostly positive things about everything but Cadillac's cars; and the things being said about Cadillac were enough to make someone in the market, draw a line through the brand altogether -- with the possible exception of the Escalade.

One couple drove their new Mercedes GLA crossover -- which I was able to see up close and personal, interior included. Very nice looking car -- especially from the outside. Interior fit and finish seemed nice, but man the thing was really small inside -- smaller, I think, than an Audi Q3. I don't know how much actual utility it had, how many groceries it could carry, but I do think it is one of Mercedes best looking products in years.

My take away from the whole evening -- pertaining to cars -- was that Cadillac is not in a particularly good place right now with respect to what ""the people"" (the market) are saying. Here [Edmund's] we've got folks saying ""are you kidding"" with respect to the price vs the competition and you have the bourgeoisie saying the cars are, well, pretty much crap with respect to reliability.

Best of both worlds?! Yikes."

Spot on.
Audi can claim one big victory in 2014: it outsold Cadillac. Life has been difficult for Cadillac lately as it struggles to make the leap from premium – expensive cars – to the luxury category – cars whose valuable brand command an extra margin. Cadillac raised prices last year in an effort to look more exclusive, then was forced to bet a hasty retreat when customers stayed away. At the end of January, a Reuters analysis revealed that Cadillac was sitting on a four-month supply of unsold CTS sedans and six months worth of ATS sedans. Strangely, while its newer passenger cars languish, Cadillac can’t keep up with demand for the old-style Escalade SUV, some highly optioned versions of which, Reuters discovered, can carry prices in excess of $100,000."

I've driven several vehicles for well over 100K miles and have accumulated over 1.4 million miles overall. As in going to hospital, the way to success is to keep out of the shop. Most of mine have benefitted from the manufacturer's quality system, not the dealer's. YMMV

3799,markcincinnati,August 2015,"Whatever Happened to . . . .

I mentioned as part of one of my rants/posts that when I grew up in rural Ohio in the 60's, there were Chevy ""guys"" and Ford ""guys"" and even some Chryco (aka mopar) ""guys.""

The passion of the Chevy folks was the relentless kidding of the Fix Or Repair Daily crowd and of course the other way around (General Mess of Crap, as I recall). The Buick car company had seriously powerful cars -- my buddy drove a Buick Special to high school every day (and this was a full-sized V8 packin' hot rod -- don't let's it mass confuse you, you face off with the Special, you see tail lights.) Of course there were Goats and Stangs and my favorite (Beep Beep) Plymouth road runners that, in a straight line, were scary good and ready to smoke the rear tires, or actually SHRED the rear tires.

My cousin had an Impala SS (a two-door affair with a HUGE butt but also gobs of tire smokin' power) with a rear deck speaker WITH REVERB! Whew, I'm all verklempt.

The faithful high schoolers became faithful, loyal customers of their chosen brands -- my parents first had Hudson Hornets, then, with the demise of Twin H power (dual carbs), dad moved to Plymouth, then Chrysler -- I recall when I was in college he got a Cordoba, with fine Corinthian leather and the fake leather half roof.

The point is, my uncles were loyal to their brands -- my Augusta, GA uncle always had Pontiacs, his two brothers, one of them my dad had Chryco cars -- my uncle had a Plymouth Sport Fury, Plymouth's answer to the Chevy Impala Super Sport.

I mean these folks, then, wouldn't be budged from the brand.

What the heck happened?

Now, before I go into the weeds too deeply, I must say my friends are mostly loyal to a brand. My BMW driving friends will probably never stray. My buddy who drives Acuras, just won't even bother shopping elsewhere.

So what happened -- one would think there would have been at least some vestige of brand loyalty and that ought to translate to Cadillac as well. Apparently not.

What I have found is ""American"" car dealers didn't get the memo that must've come out at the end of the 70's or the early 80's. I simply, personally, can't imagine putting up with the crap these hold over dealers ""Fast Eddy's"" or ""Juicy Lucy's"" and their ilk deal.

Is it a matter of the dealerships? Is it a matter of . . . what? You'd think if you were a dealer facing a declining market, that you would ""go undercover"" and see how the most successful dealerships treat their ""clients"" and flat out imitate that behavior.

Sure, you may have to kiss a lot of frogs, but eventually you're going to learn what the attraction is -- at least at the Premium and Lux brands -- a Cadillac dealer with even one Fast Eddy or Juicy Lucy on the payroll isn't going to cut it.

Of course, this doesn't wipe out all of the sins of an iffy product, but maybe it would help.

Man, if I were Audi's former, now Cadillac's top US Exec, I would be calling in every favor I could to, as Young Frankenstein once said ""Get me the hell outta here -- don't you recognize a joke?"""

Apparently they are not interested in ""driving dynamics"" as much as they used to be -- on the other hand, we'd be hard pressed these days to find virtually any up and coming ""customer"" to even consider a manual transmission; sport suspensions, too, seem to be largely in the rearview mirror -- I remember when MOST of the cars in stock had sport suspensions, sport seats and at the same time a good many of the cars in stock were manual shift models, replete with Premium pack, power assists, and other options of the day.

Now, the few sticks offered are strippies (often) and for the most part, the cars are -- as noted -- getting squishy, less taught, with less of the performance edge. Although, oddly, HP and torque do continue to climb.

This whole discussion been interesting, GM needed to make room for the ATS, that meant the CTS needed to be price higher then before, GM needed to take a couple of play from the likes of Lexus and Hyundai more content at a lower price, then slowly raise prices I don't think the CTS was moving up the price trail as it was being improved. Now, I have two neighbors who have CTS, both are V6, both have been stone reliable, one is a 2012, then other is a 2013. I remember when the ATS cane out and a couple of people where praising the car, Myself and a couple of others pointed out the biggest issue with the CTS and ATS was simple, their size, they are too small in the segment they are in.

OK, time for the 45,000 mile service on the '14 SQ5. Dropping the car off the night before, picking up a courtesy car for the day and coming back 24 hours later . . . routine.

""I'm sorry, I don't have any SQ5 loaners . . . but I've got this freshly PDR'd car that has 35 miles on it you can have, if you don't mind. It's an A8L. I also have a new A7, but I thought you might like to be the very first customer to drive the A8.""

Actually, I had hoped for an A6 -- considering some of our recent ""chats"" here on edmunds. But, it is so very unlikely we'd ever willingly, knowingly and with our own money go for another A8 (not that we didn't like our previous one), well, why not.

I am a lover and geek on all things Audi, but frankly I just don't spend any time keeping up with the A8 or R8 cars, I needed an edumacation . . . .

This was the L version -- the back seat space is larger than some closets or storage sheds, if the thing wasn't so quiet at speed, you'd need an intercom to speak to the pilot were you seated back there,

Otherwise, we set the drive select to dynamic (the rep looked at my wife who set this parameter after starting the car, and said ""go figure"" -- my wife is used to an SQ5, after all) and turned on the heads-up display, found some nice tuneage on the sat radio and drove off in eerie silence arriving a triple digits speeds in the blink of an eye. Yikes this thing must be electric it is so quiet and smoooth (and this one had the air suspension, which I suspect is standard and the 20"" wheels with summer only rubber.)

Full LED front and rear lighting -- and everything that could be motorized was -- and oh that fantastic, should be mandated by the Feds, Top View monitor (how I miss that one aspect of our 2011 Infiniti).

I finally got the sticker out of the glove box and noted this puppy was a V6 (333HP) -- my S4's V6. Impressive in this size car as it never seemed to want for any bit of power -- there was always plenty on reserve.

Air conditioned seats -- ahhhhh cooling those hot crossed buns -- I had forgotten how nice cool leather can feel, even on a hot summer day.

Here's the real deal, however -- while the car is, even were it free -- too large, it feels not much larger than my S4. Also, I cannot tell a lie, it is not as nimble as an S4, and certainly not as powerful as you would expect with the extra girth the motor had to manage, but it seemed quite capable of convincing perhaps the vast majority of folks that it was a sporting-like sedan, not just a luxo-barge. The top view camera made navigating a tight parking garage this morning easy-peazy.

If you have $92,000 (but this one had a nearly $6,000 Executive package credit, wiping out the Executive package price) laying around burning a hole wanting to be spent on a new luxury but still very much a driver's car vehicle, say no more, look no further. I can't imagine my neighbor's 7 series (also an L) which, by comparison, seems so stark and strident inside -- and which cost over $110K could be more attractive, price weighted.

I don't know how the 2016 A8L 3.0T is thought of by the pros, but this amateur thinks for $86,000 nothing even comes close -- in this class (large luxo-barge).

Of course, had I that much coin to drop on ONE car, I would still ""settle"" on a full-on great balls of fire S6 Prestige with the custom red leather seats.

Now that would be something to write home about.

Me, I'm looking forward to a slightly larger 2018 S4 with all the cool tech this 2016 A8 has on it.

I did look at a Panamera -- and with anything even close to the content of the A8, the price would shoot over $100K.

The Audi that I would think much more competitive (in every aspect) with the Panamera is the RS7. This A8L was an ocean-going vessel -- the fact that it felt smaller than its barge like dimensions doesn't make it anything that would be attractive to someone who would look at either an RS7 or Panamera, if you axe me.

While I liked the temporary experience, I wouldn't even consider one, personally. I wonder if the S8 might be more of a Panamera cross-shopper. Don't know . . . and not all that interested in making a comparison, at this point, life's too short. A half step between an A4 and A6 is about the size I find interesting today.

About $58K for my S4 and about $65K for my wife's SQ5 -- what's that come to?"" $123K -- for TWO cars. Something just seems ""off"" about spending that much on ONE car -- but I could be wrong. There comes a point where I read about the $85K Cadillac V or M3 and their accelerations to 62MPH are in the neighborhood of 4 seconds. I then go back in time and find the same magazine's numbers for my ""lowly"" S4 to be 4.8 seconds (some magazines claim even quicker). I'll keep the $27K for other things and make certain never to challenge an M3 to a drag race at the local traffic light. I'm all for big bad acceleration, etc, but all that money for such a relatively small increase in acceleration is something that I find very difficult to justify, especially since it is so rare I can ever floor my non-tumescent S4 for fear of overtaking and rear ending just about everything else on the road."

I think his wants/desires were based on the marketing of his era (40s-50s) when U.S. based car companies ruled the market. Just like GM wanted, you started with a Chevy, went to maybe Oldsmobile, then Buick and finally, Cadillac. Ford started you with their namesake, moved you to Mercury, and finally Lincoln. Chrysler started you at Plymouth, then to Dodge, then to Chrysler, and finally to Imperial (yes, my Father had one...no branded Chrysler but Imperial).

Cadillac, Lincoln, Imperial were the pinnacles of automotive excellence during those decades. European, and particularly Japanese brands were viewed with disdain in our household, at the time.

3828,markcincinnati,August 2015,"My wife and I have been to Europe/Germany perhaps twenty to twenty-five times (some trips, not many, didn't include Germany, that is) -- we always fly into Munich, even if our destination is Venice or Zurich or even Vienna. Of all of the European cities we've been to, Munich is the one where I think I could live AND work. Much as we like Verona and Prague, and even Kraków (and what's not to like about London, Paris and even Brussles), Munich is THE city where I think I could work. The train from Munich to Venice, via Innsbruck is the most beautiful ride we've ever taken -- and OMG in winter, as my friend says, ""If there is winter in heaven, this is what it MUST look like.""

But, as usual, I digress. I really do have a, hopefully legitimate, question for you flightnurse: What would have been the American MSRP of your new BMW and what was the difference due to buying the car via ED? The last time I looked into this, it seemed that the price delta paid for the trip -- and then, if you factor in the cost of renting a car, you actually end up paying only for your hotels and food, making the trip to some of the most beautiful sights on the planet about equal to or less than a trip to the US west coast (from Cincinnati).

Of course, I would agree, if you're in Germany and/or other European countries, you may splurge on restaurants and (if in Italy) clothes and other items unavailable in the US.

To wit: if you two read this and are going to circle back to Munich, our 2nd favorite restaurant on earth is in Munich, it is called Tantris.

Bon Appétite! (I had to misspell this to prevent the nanny from suppressing it. . .'cmon now!)"
3829,dino001,August 2015,"Yeah, the ED MSRP is 7 percent off base model US MSRP plus destination and options are priced at US MSRP. It makes base models especially great deals, then as you add options, the discount gets smaller. So for example 50k base plus 5k options plus 900 destination it is 52.4k, or 3.5 grand nominal savings. However, you don't get any additional rebates, like those cash credits or rebates that BMW sometimes throws for the US delivery (disclaimers often specifically exclude ED). You can negotiate the price down from the ED MSRP toward their invoice just the same as US delivery (unlike Benz or Volvo, which have the ED prices price fixed), but many dealers would have none of it. Don't know why, perhaps it's just posturing, but I heard of that several times. I think it may be their way of discouraging of doing it, as they always prefer intant gratification of delivery, so the attitude may be, fine, but I'm not doing a damn thing to incentivise the deal vs. my stock. There are also complications with the trade, if you want to make one, as there is about three month from signing the deal and getting the car. Essentially, you lose any leverage on the trade price, unless you are willing to give the car at time of the signing the deal.

Bottom line, the actual savings depend on the context of its actual going transaction prices for stock Deliveries. For models selling close to MSRP, like say M-models, the savings are great. For those selling closer to invoice, or having extra cash rebates, it is less. However, factoring the extra vacation experience, even if the savings aren't as big as the face value, it's totally worth it. BTW, you can combine ED with so-called Performance Delivery in South Carolina, which makes the experience even more awesome. Paid night at Sheraton, dinner, breakfast, morning at a track, doing quick loops, braking, skip pad (not your car, just one that's a same or similar similar model; they put me in 335), then a factory visit, plus X5 off-road course after lunch.

3838,markcincinnati,August 2015,"In the mid-1980's, I owned an Audi (what else?) 5000CS turbo quattro, then Audi's top-of-the-line car. Manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes) anti-lock brakes. For some reason I ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. But that’s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this.

This mid-80’s Audi had a permanently mounted voice controlled and activated cellular telephone. While driving, if I uttered the phrase “Turn on telephone” I could “Call home,” “Call office,” or recite a phone number – one number at a time, wait for the phone to repeat the number, and so on until the full number had been spoken, then dial. Hands free, eyes free. It was 1985.

My first Audi S6, a 1996 model was the next Audi I purchased that came with a factory phone (it was hidden in the arm-rest) permitting voice command. This version was updated and allowed me to recite the phone number in single digits without waiting for the phone to parrot my number back to me.

When I then purchased a new 1997 A8, I was somewhat amazed that it came pre-wired for a phone, but without a phone. Of course I ponied up for another voice activated phone. When I got my 2003 allroad it came with a special in-armrest holder for an Audi-branded phone and it also came with On*Star which was also a phone (voice activated) and an email client (that read my emails to me and also allowed me to send emails by speaking). My 2005 A6 was bluetooth equipped and came with a list of phones I could buy from several different providers and also had a special, in-armrest holder/charger that was invisible with the arm-rest cover closed.

My 2009 A4, 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and my 2014 S4 also are equipped with bluetooth and they also have pig-tails for charging and [iPhone] music connectivity. Every one of these cars I mention, since 1985, has had hand and eyes free phone capability and ever improving voice command capabilities.

I finally have gotten around to keeping my iPhone in my breast pocket, but for years my iPhone often was in the trunk where I put my brief case. The phone works fine when it is in the trunk – and now, since I do use the phone for email and texting (after pulling over), I tend to keep the phone in the cabin.

Every few seconds or minutes someone has a crash or is killed and the “incident” (they are not accidents) causing the property damage or living being damage is attributed to texting or other mobile device distracted driving.

The technology exists to disallow talking and texting in a moving vehicle. I assume no challenge would exist to make the phone work if it is being used via bluetooth hand and eyes free initiation. The clock is ticking backwards, to zero, to a time when we will have no ability to use these communication’s devices in a moving car.

Here’s what confuses me: Since there had been some kind of hand and eyes free, voice-activated communications available since the mid-1980’s, how is it possible that I cannot drive more than one mile out of my rural subdivision without seeing someone driving their ELLPS (and I’ll keep it to ELLPS cars, even though such technology is hardly limited to the Premium class and above) with their phone held up to their ear (requiring one hand)? As I get closer to the Interstate and traffic density increases, I could probably throw a handful of rice into oncoming traffic and hit more cars than not whose drivers are holding their phones – and I am certain many of the rice grains would hit bluetooth equipped vehicles.

Before you respond, here’s another data point, most of the cars have one person in them – the driver.

I get my car serviced, I am provided with a loaner – before I pull out of the dealership, I pair my phone with the loaner’s Bluetooth – if I’m distracted, this takes 30 seconds. My wife actually has the service manager pair her phone with the loaner, figuring it’s part of the Audi Advantage (and the service writer always takes the 30 seconds to do this for her without issue).

I thought, way back there 30 years ago, “I can completely be focussed on driving this stick-shift turbo-charged ‘hot rod’ quattro thanks to my hands and eyes free cellular phone.” Is this technology not “way cool”? And, is this technology not a HUGE safety feature, right up there with seat belts, crumple zones, ESP and ABS, sealed beam headlights, disc brakes and so on?

I do want to be able to call home or the office without touching the phone, without looking at the phone and without pulling over and parking due to the inevitable governmental safety nanny. I want to delay yet another restriction brought on by my fellow drivers who opt for the most dangerous and deadly way I can think of to make a phone call.

Of course, maybe we’ll be allowed to used a phone in the car once cars start driving themselves. Mean time, I’d just like to advocate for voluntary cessation of in-car phone usage if it is not hand and eyes free.

The nav system on the BMW can be set to drive only on highways and toll roads or not, so this leg, we didn't want that, we wanted the scenic route, so we entered the address of where we were going to stay (Villa Trapp, you know the Von Trapp Family) and off we went, Rick and I both like the heads up display. About half way there Rick hit the ""mode"" button on the steering wheel and somehow reset our destination back to Ettal. I wasn't paying attention to this, About an hour later I noticed some of the area looks familiar then I noticed what happened on Nav screen. no problem, reprogram the Nav and off we go.

The country side is amazing, green as far as you can see, NO trash on the side of the roads, no billboards. On the back roads you get a lot of people on bikes, so you have to watch out for them. Overall Cars, motorcycles and bike get along well.

2015 Subaru Outback 3.6R / 2014 MINI Countryman S ALL4"
3844,markcincinnati,August 2015,"FN -- I don't know how everyone else feels, but I want you to know you cannot post too many pictures as far as I'm concerned.

I rented a MB in Munich (an E class) -- this was a few years ago -- and it had navigation. The entire thing was in German. Although it offered up arrows and the map, although in German, was easy enough to figure out. I actually got to know the word for left (turn) and for right, so we were able to use the system a great deal of the time. It got a little dicey in town, but when we put in a Hotel (name here) we mostly got close enough for jazz to it.

Is your navigation lady German or English speaking?"
3845,markcincinnati,August 2015,"???

Driver of a late model Lexus merges onto I-75 south, immediately moves to the left-most lane, slows to 50 (apparently setting cruise control) and using one free hand, starts holding the phone to his ear -- the conversation apparently goes on for many miles, although I broke protocol after a few miles and committed one of the most vile acts anyone can do behind the wheel . . . I passed on the right after my repeated attempts at turning on my left turn signal were ignored.

I'm all for most freedoms -- really. But, you can't yell fire in a theater (unless there really is one) and expect to be covered by the first amendment. I guess, technically, there is no reason you can't hop onto a major federal highway and drive in the left-most lane at 50 MPH (the speed limit here in Ohio has, in many places, now been bumped to 70); I also assume passing on the right side (or suicide) isn't illegal. But, and it pains me to say this, I would vote for laws that would disallow both of these behaviors, were such items placed on a ballot. But, then again, I am also in the minority that votes.

We're doomed.

Just another reason I can't imagine the frustration of owning/driving an RS7 or M5 or CTS-V, etc, where in wide wide world of sports can such machines be driven using more than a fraction of their engineer-imbued ""talents?"" Not that a Prius is all of a sudden looking good.

One more note - I would imagine that driving in Italy would be a free-for-all (and Rome, actually, is). But, other than perhaps a slight decrease in speed, the folks driving on the Italian Autobahn (the autostrada, as I recall), behave pretty much exactly like the Germans -- lane discipline, left lane to pass and the lanes get faster the further left you go, period. Folks respond to a wink of your turn signal to get over and, from what I can tell (other than in Rome) there is no road-rage.

Although many of our Interstate road surfaces are pock-marked, I generally think we have a well thought out (mostly) highway system here, that is rendered far less efficient that it could be by either ignorance, stupidity or lack of driver training. Instead, here, we rely, in this order, upon: Enforcement (sort of), Engineering (a somewhat distant second) and Education (a very distant third.) I would think we could drive faster, experience fewer delays, fewer hours lost per person, per year, etc, if we just made getting a driver's license require a bit more rigor. One would think, considering the death-rate, that getting a DL should require no less preparation and education than getting a pilot's license. My wife got her pilot's license before she was old enough to get a driver's license -- and she thinks that getting a DL is about like getting a box-top off of a box of Wheaties.

Something is wrong with that.

One last note: I love test driving all kinds of cars, despite my completely above-board bias toward Audis, German cars and European cars, generally. I have taken so many folks on test drives these past 5-10 years, I can't remember just how many. Not one (other than my wife) has ever had ABS engaged (that they know of -- although I wonder if they just don't know what ABS braking feels like); and the thing is, when I -- in a large deserted parking lot -- get them to engage ABS, the moment the pedal pulsing starts, they [so they say] instinctively know to release the brake to the point the pulsing stops.

I have been through 4-two day Audi Driving Experiences (on ice), 1-two day BMW Driving Experience (not on ice) one Porsche Driving Experience (1-day) and a Cadillac driving experience (also 1-day). Every instructor literally starts the training with the following exercise: accelerate to about 50MPH from a dead stop and when you reach the orange cone laying on its side at the end of the ""runway"" press the brake pedal ""as if"" this is a panic stop. To a man/woman instructor, the command is ""when the pulsing is felt through the pedal, press the brake as hard as your leg can press -- imagine your goal is to BEND THE BRAKE PEDAL.""

The reason given for this ""press harder"" instruction is always, ""braking force will continue to increase the harder you press, even with Brake Assist (which bases braking force somewhat on the speed at which the driver presses down)."" I've seen this impact myself on dry, wet and icy pavement.

Yet, when I try to get someone who is testing a new car to brake with any degree of urgency, the instant the pulsing is felt, they release the brake -- which, were this a real emergency could increase the probability of a crash.

We need to license drivers much, much more rigorously. And, despite this old fashion notion, I think knowing how to drive a manual transmission would be helpful too, much in the same way it is said that video games are helpful prerequisites for so many endeavors.

I happen to love my DSG transmission, but in a heartbeat, going back to a six-speed manual wouldn't be anything but fun.

A friend of mine is married to an Ohio State trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding. Bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced.

Why is that? Are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? Wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: If the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.

I'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. And, then, of course, enforce them.

So, if my friend's trooper husband is correct, that passing on the right side really is suicide and that speeding, in an of itself is less likely to cause death and destruction, why not ""align the time (i.e., the fine) with the crime"" so to speak? Full disclosure, I have little compunction about driving 85 or 90 in a 70 zone (with assured clear distance), but, as noted, I break out in hives and nausea if I am dragged kicking and screaming into passing on the right due to some moron who certainly must be ignoring my repeated wink, wink, winking left turn signal ""the universal (and polite) signal to please let me pass.""

OK, I have one more ? to pose -- I took driver's ed in high school, I took a course to learn to teach driver's ed in college -- why is it we are taught to maintain about 15' per 10MPH assured clear distance between you and the car in front of you (on the highway, not on the crowded stop and go streets of, say, Manhattan) yet, if you were even to attempt to keep 90' between you and the car in front of you on the state highway or Interstate highway at 60MPH, you are assured someone will risk heaven and earth, life and limb to squeeze in between you and the car in front of you and then essentially brake hard, thereby causing a ripple effect of some dozens and dozens of miles on such thoroughfares as the long flat and straight stretch of highway say between Cincinnati and Columbus OH?

Traffic flow = the ""Natural Speed Limit."" Several studies show that if the speed limit on a given highway is 65 and the flow is 80 - 85, that the flow remains virtually unchanged, when the speed limit is raised to 75 or 80 even. The flow of traffic like the ebb and flow (rise and fall) of the stock market really does have a mind of its own. Efforts to enforce (and seriously fine) lane protocols would do far more to increase the safety of many of our highways than ""speed traps"" will ever do.

There will be folks who drive at 110MPH when the speed limit is 65 or 80 -- that doesn't change. If the natural speed is 85, the ""NORMAL"" range will be 80 - 90MPH. Go figure.

Me, I do pass on the right, but only after sincere and polite attempts to get the Left-Lane-Bandit to move over, I'm crazy, I know, but I do have physical symptoms that arise when I pass on the right -- it seems like breaking a societal covenant restricting and preventing us, mostly, from having ""stupid attacks.""

There is still some ""badge engineering"" in other manufacturers, including VAG. In Europe, they have Skoda, Seat, VW models differing mostly by some styling and interior, but essentially identical otherwise (with ""special model"" exceptions). Not as visible here, as VW to Audi separation is much more pronounced, especially within current US market offerings. Other do much worse job of separating models, especially in lower end of the premium brands, where majority of their entry level models are barely changed in comparison to their close common relatives. Lincoln MKZ/Ford Fusion, Acura CLX/Honda Civic come in mind, especially their lower level trims. Even previous generation Audi A3/VW Golf GTI were not as far apart, as they should be.
I actually found the previous generation A3 and GTI to differ greatly. However, with the GTI continually making many improvements, I find the 2015 GTI to finally be up to snuff. Of course, since they've caught up at VW with the GTI to the A3, they no longer offer a 5-door A3 (although I think that's changing with the A3 E-Tron's).

3857,andres3,August 2015,"The fact traffic enforcement concentrates on speeding tickets (which lead to virtually no danger or accidents), and routinely completely ignores left lane passing laws is one of the biggest crimes of the past century. Police should absolutely ticket the driver causing the problem (the left lane impeder) rather than the symptoms (people passing on the right).

No one ever accused the highway patrol of using logic or common sense though.

A friend of mine is married to an Ohio State trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding. Bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced.

Why is that? Are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? Wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: If the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.

I'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. And, then, of course, enforce them.

So, if my friend's trooper husband is correct, that passing on the right side really is suicide and that speeding, in an of itself is less likely to cause death and destruction, why not ""align the time (i.e., the fine) with the crime"" so to speak? Full disclosure, I have little compunction about driving 85 or 90 in a 70 zone (with assured clear distance), but, as noted, I break out in hives and nausea if I am dragged kicking and screaming into passing on the right due to some moron who certainly must be ignoring my repeated wink, wink, winking left turn signal ""the universal (and polite) signal to please let me pass.""

If I'm not mistaken, here in Colorado, you can get ticketed for driving in the left lane on the highway if you're not passing. I'm not so sure how much it is enforced, but I do like that the law is at least there.

3861,flightnurse,September 2015,"So it's 1045pm had a great day, we are staying in Erbusco Italy, it's about 20 miles east of Bergamo, where my surname is from, going to meet cousins I have never meet before.. We are staying in a place called L'Alberete it's a hotel right in the middle of wine country, the views are breathtaking.

So to catch you up on the driving from yesterday, we left Salzburg to go to Lake Hallstatt, what a place, and the tourist love it. It's also home to one of the biggest salt mines in Austria. The Drive there was about 2 hours, nothing to really report, ate lunch hung around and left, about 2pm. Now this is where it gets weird, we I put the info into the Nav system to get us to Ljubljana, Solvenia I told it NOT to take toll road or highway. This was a big mistake. The Nav system said it was about 200 KM away, and said we would arrive about 6pm, About two hours into the drive I noticed the time to arrive keep getting longer, I went back into the nav system and saw what was chosen as the route all ""B"" roads.. I fixed this but we were so far buried into the ALPS it didn't matter, we saw some great places, then we came upon a accident. After sitting for about 30 minutes, one of the fireman came up and told us we can wait 2-3 hours before it is cleared or we can turn around and take the ""detour"", when I asked him about this detour he couldn't answer the question, mind you the Nav gave us an alternate routes but we had to go forward about 20km before they took effect (that wasn't going to work.) so we turned around and followed people who were just as lost, but they spoke German. We got a gas station and asked someone there, they gave us direction and found the detour,once we got half way through the detour we turn the Nav back on and found us a route to get moving. But this route, routed us OVER the ALPS, we hit the highest point of 1765 meters (close to 6K ft) we finally got into Slovenia, and arrived at are hotel about 815pm, about 2 hours later then we wanted.. Ljubljana is a wonderful city, we hit the town about 845 for dinner, we were supised on how many people were walking about, we were by the river that splints the city in town. Lots of history there and we both want to go back. It's a very modern city.

Salzburg has large elect bus network, but you have to see this mess all over the place.



Austria, like German have a lot of lakes, this is just one of them. Here we meet a daughter and father who were riding bikes from Munich to Lake Halstatt they are on holiday..



Hatchback and Wagons are all over the place in Germany and Austria, this has to be one of the more popular models around Europe, I would day 90% of them are diesels I saw many 118d or 120d's. BMW also makes this as a 3 door hatch, also the A3 5 door (the one we get) as well as the A1 is very popular, and most are oil burners.



First real photos of the car in bright sunlight the blue look amazing..






The 3 series has a mid-life cycle for 2016, but the GT and 4 series do not get one, however, both the GT and 4 series have received some updates that the 3 series gets. First the Rims, these have more of a grey tone to them less silver, also the middle consul and AC controls are different and lastly, the rear exhaust is black not silver this photo shows the rear exhaust.



The next two are in Lake Hallstatt, truly an amazing place.





Last is a shot of a town we detoured through, got to love iPhones and GPS, I had no idea the name of this town, but when you take a photo with the phone it says the GPS coordinates and will stamp the photo with the name later on. The name of this town is Bad Aussee, it was really charming. BTW I don't think this town gets this many cars..."

Maybe this is old fashioned thinking.

It seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. When the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.

I've taken the tour through the Audi factory in Germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. There is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). There were dozens of Audi colors apparently able to be specified -- I would call them non-custom.

I understand that Pearl Swirl Pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, I assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps Bentley does this, but I would not imagine Audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)

We're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra. The Audi Exclusive line (should one venture into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.

It just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question. Silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black Audi calls Panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. Pull the other one.

I know, I know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and I do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want. This is especially annoying since most folks don't order their cars, and therefore have no say.

Rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is. But at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.

Even the Ibis White (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.

I had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my S4, but I would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet RED leather was $1,000 upcharge. God help me if I wanted the leather in a non-standard color.

I'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seats -- those options weren't available. But 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up? Luckily I am fine with white.

Now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is OK.

I've watched the cars being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost THAT much extra to get one in silver?

It's all marketing and revenue maximization. Show a lower base price, but then make sure everything is an upcharge. BMW has been doing this for decades, Audi (at least in the US) not as long but they are getting there more and more.

It's the same reason you can get a certain cell phone for some lower price but the base model has only 16Gb which is pretty minimal. Of course the upcharge to 32 or 64Mb is way out of proportion to the actual cost of those changes for the manufacturer. Instant profit!"

BMW has what they call Individual colors for both exterior and Interior leather colors, as well as Options, when you choose an Individual color the car gets painted at a different facility, so the added price is the while process. Now, the 3 GT is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. So for our GT to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. BMWNA does not allow for Individual options on the 3 series in the US, but they are available for BMWAG customers.

3877,flightnurse,September 2015,"So the trip from Slovenia to Erbusco Italy was a straight shot on the Autostrata, as we wanted to get to the resort we were staying at, it exceeded our expectation, it is nestled in the foothills of wine country of northern Italy, the resort is surrounded by grape vineyards, a perfect place to relax. Once we arrived, we just drove around the area to take in the sights.

Yesterday we went to Lake Como, now lake Como is shaped like an upside down Y, for me it's one of the most beautiful area's of Italy, when we left the resort it was gloomy and overcast, on the trip up we got hit with a very heavy downpour which cleaned the windshield of all bugs! We stopped in Varenna for lunch, then took the Ferry to Bellagio (yes, the hotel in Vegas is named after the city.) Then we drove home, but the rain had stopped but was still gloomy. Didn't matter the area is still beautiful.

Hotel in Varenna, just on the water.



Waiting for the Ferry to arrive, the Bently's owner saw our plates and asked where we were from, when I told him he stated he was jealous of what we North Americans can do with the ED.

A short train ride from Venice, however, is Verona -- a city (well, town) that while certainly for the [German] tourists, retains walkability without pain, and, for my money has better restaurants, by far, than are widely available in Venice.

The ""oldest restaurant in Italy, Europe? the World?"" is in Verona -- it is called The 12 Apostles, and the food there bests even Tantris (Munich's best, I think).

3880,flightnurse,September 2015,"So we drove from Erbusco to Marseilles France yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast..

So my impressions of Italian drivers, they aren't as reckless as you hear about, they follow most of the German or Austrian driving rules, 1) they only use the Right lane to pass, 2) they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over, and 3) yes, some are crazy.

So we are motoring down the A5 autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down, then barreling down on us is a VW passat wagon (they are big in Italy) and yes, it's a TDI.. The VW driving is flashing his lights, turn signal on, looks pissed that I didn't move over, Once we clear traffic and people move over (this whole time VW driver is inch's from my bumper) I nail the gas (we have 2200km on the car) and wham, talk off. VW growing smaller and smaller in the mirror. Top out at 135mph, we reach slower traffic, VW own barreling down doing the same thing, flashing lights, turn signal, giving me the Italian salute, not too sure if it was a good one or bad one. Again, once traffic opens up, and people move up, I take off, and the VW gets smaller and smaller in the mirror. Again, top out at 135, reach slower traffic, again VW driver flashing lights and turn signal, this time once we clear traffic, I get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land (this A5 has 3 lane's in each direction) and the VW pulled up, it's quite funny, he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast, I nail it get in front, and pull away. Had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph. VW owner catch's up and passes me.. He finally got what he wanted. It's interesting that it doesn't matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster..

France

What to say about France, if you think the Germans have an aire of attitude, you need to come from France. The attitude is, we can do that because we are french... Merging traffic, they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front, they don't care about their cars, well most french don't.

We stopped in Monaco, did the tourist thing, stopped in front f the Casino, and got a photo of the car, TALK ABOUT CROWDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cars, WOW, the Cars, I got one photo of a Lambo, lots of make there too. The streets are narrow REALLY narrow.. Lots of construction going on and our GPS wasn't updated on this, so it took a little longer to get to the Casino, but we got there.

Marseilles

What to say about Marseilles, I didn't know much about the city except it was a port city. It's a very old city, and it shows, when you come in from the toll road, you come in through the slums, the GPS worked great, some of the streets we went down, were REALLY narrow,dirty, and stinky. Insane is a word that Rick used a lot....

My thoughts of Marseilles, lots of immigrants, usually from north Africa, lots of different cultures, Christians, Muslims and so on. Have seen some women in Burka's walking about here and all over Europe, the native people of Marseilles aren't happy with most of the immigrants. It's a very diverse city, the food says it all, more on that later.

So here are the photos from our trip to France..

In Italy they have rest stop's but nothing like what have in the US, the rest stop has gas, food and places to eat the food outside, and they are SUPERCLEAN... The next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on.













So we stopped at a French version of the roadside gas/convenience store what a big difference, the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown, hardly no drinks in the coolers, and the bathrooms look disgusting (this was the real reason why we stopped) see for yourself. A far cry from what the ones in Italy looked like,







So car's in Europe, we have seen some American cars over here, here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh at.




Monaco is supper clean, VERY clean in fact. Monaco is not a country, it is part of France, but it is a Principality, their license plates say, Principality of Monaco on them..








So I know you are all waiting for that Lambo photo, so here it is..



Traffic lights are interesting here, if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights, but the French being The French have a fix....




Once again the GPS, she works well, she really does but at times I have to wonder, when we left Monaco, we put into the GPS the hotel address and said, the faster route, even toll roads, well..... For about 60 km we were on two lane country roads, then finally back on the toll roads.. She tries..



So I'll end this installment with a photo taken from our Balcony over looking the harbor and looking at the monument that is roughly 500 yrs old, it's a night photo.."

Yes to all. France has a transponder system call Liber-T that works like EZ Pass. The toll booths take cash in multiple currencies including Euros, US Dollars, Swiss Francs, UK Pounds, et al as well as credit cards."
3887,markcincinnati,September 2015,"You commented about German, er, personalities then followed up with your observations about French personalities. Granted, my European travels have been entirely recreational, but I would say that only in 2 countries have I ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious. France (several times) and Switzerland once in Lucerne (come to think of it the person in Lucerne had a heavy French accent.)

The German people have always been friendly, polite, courteous and sometimes playful even. I've been to Oktoberfest about 6 times, and when going into a beer tent, you join a large group of people at a picnic table and within a few minutes it seems the folks are wanting to know about the US, US sports and are trying to teach us Americans some of the German-only songs that come up every 15 minutes or so between good ol' Rock and Roll. A gentleman and his father were in Munich for Oktoberfest and when they found out my wife was a lawyer, the older man bought my wife an order of peeled radishes (covered in salt) from one barrister to another. We had a great time. The folks on the subways in Munich, too, are always willing to help you figure out which stop will get you closest to your destination.

In France, on the other hand, we went to a bistro, like you see in the movies, in Paris and the waiter gave up his picture for the dictionary next to the word ""surly"". Apparently since tipping is not as serious as it is in the US, this waiter was actually pissed when we thanked him (in English) when he brought us our wine, beer and cheese saying (in heavily accented French) ""why can't you people even TRY to speak French?"" OK, well perhaps I could say merci, but other than asking ""how's the weather"" and saying ""I like chocolate ice cream"" I didn't think I wanted to embarrass myself or run the risk of butchering my communications (especially since the menu we were given was multi-lingual). How wude!

The staff at our (5-star) hotel in Paris was totally gracious and friendly, but my impression, from several interactions with the locals, was that they don't like us much -- or maybe they just don't like me. I went ahead and gave an American tip anyway, who knows if anything changed. The Italians were huggers and both-cheek kissers (didn't have that happen in Germany, but they were friendlier than the French.)

FN, I have no clue as to your age -- I am 63 -- I started going to Europe when I was about 20 years younger (and richer), but it can be done for not too much money, if you realize that most of the time you spend in a Hotel it is dark (meaning, 3-star hotels with air conditioning work just fine). Once I got over the sense that we needed 5 star hotels (because, well, you never know), we found we could see Europe for not much money (saving our coin for fine dining instead). Also, we don't use cabs anymore, we figure out how to use the trains and subways -- and for the long trips, we splurge on first class train travel if the distance is over 5 hours. Also became a fan of night trains with full size beds (saves on hotel bills too). My point is, unless you're much much older, I urge you to make this trip one of many, many more you should take. Benelux was a fun couple of trips -- Amsterdam, Brussles and Luxembourg city, do it again, do it again.

Anyway, you've taken me, at least, on a great vicarious trip with you two. My only regret is that you didn't get an Audi, but there's always next time.

Scooters are the way to get around town, and let me tell you they will let you know it too. Just a random shot




Yes, they are looking for the next winner of The Voice of France here in Marseilles




Ok so we are americans, we stopped in a Mikey D's to get a coke, interesting place, you can order take out or have it served at your table and order at this Kiosk, the McCafe is a separate area in Miky D's, they had pastries and macaroon's.






So now it's all about the car's we saw, the first if a Peugeot wagon, very popular and a looker too.




Another Peugeot hatchback




Here is an Audi A2




Here is a surprise, this is a Kia, called a Ceep, very good looking car.





We can park how we want, because we are French..



The Mediterranean, and sorry guys no topple women at this beach...



An Alfa 147, another popular car in Europe



The names car companies give their cars, we had a good laugh at this one.



So the next couple of photos are interesting, we ran into a wedding procession of the well to do, all the license plates were from Monaco.





This AMG did not sound stock at all..







Now this is what the Bride rode in, a limo of a Chrysler 300 with a RR front end...




Now some random photos of the city






On our walk back to the Hotel we came upon this glass cover, very interesting, this is a photo of my taking a photo straight up, looking down at me.




Just the harbor




So some of the Chrysler cars are brought over here but sold as Lancia, the 300 is called the Thema, It's a big car over here..

And that is why the French don't like Americans. Most don't even bother to try to speak in French instead expecting everyone else to speak English. Well guess what - they do but they appreciate your faulting attempt to speak their language. Once you start to ""embarrass"" yourself they will speak with you in English. It's called courtesy. How would you feel if a tourist came up to you in Cincinnati and started speaking in French without even an attempt to speak English? I'm guessing the same as that waiter.

When I travel to Quebec, my limited French gets a smile and a hearty English reply."
3894,dino001,September 2015,"These sensitivities can run very deep and show up in surprising places. For example, in Belgium there are Flemish (Dutch) speekers and French Wallons. Brussels is a French speaking enclave in the middle of Flanders, the locals feel the have been ""invaded"" by French speakers, both government and European Union officials. You can imagine the Flemish not appreciating that. It is considered polite there (at least by the Flemish) that when you want to communicate in French, you ASK if they speak French. They do, but they want to be asked.

Similar thing goes in some post Soviet Union countries. They all are working very hard building their national identities, often overcompensating. Most speak Russian, but they again have to be asked.

Here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that France used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world. Until WW2 French was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in French journals). All of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (France didn't put much longer resistance than half sized Poland, attacked from behind by Sovients). Reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him. BTW, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc. You get the picture.

To be clear, I'm not trying to diminish your father's sacrifice, or Americas role in the War, or the fact that people in Europe should be grateful for it. I'm from the part if the world that had misfortune to be ""liberated' by the Red Army and I would trade with French in a second. However, you also need to understand the wounded pride, which resulted in irrational lashing out against the very people who don't deserve it, but are close and convenient. The best way to deal with it is shrug it off and not get too flustered. It's just ignorance. Also, you need to remember that while substantial sacrifice was made, USA was also by far the greatest beneficiary of the new world order after the War and the casualties suffered are not even in the same order of magnitude and devastation than those suffered by the Europeans. Average European sees America as a net beneficiary of the War and it's not an unfair view from the global perspective (grant you not necessarily you father's).

American soldier came, fought gallantly, often died or got wounded, but then came back to his country that was intact and stronger than ever. French, Polish, or even English soldier had to stay in their ruined country, rebuild it from ground up, sometimes starving in the process, often having his family decimated. Having those proportions being remember, you may find out much easier to get along, even with French.

3901,markcincinnati,September 2015,"I agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc. I did take history in elementary, high-school and at Miami University. As a visitor in many European and Central European (I've not gone east of the Czech Republic or Poland) I have not ever felt I should be entitled to anything due to America's participation and help in past wars. I have Brussel-ian, Italian, Netherlandian and Luxemborgian (?) relatives. My relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in The Haugue speak, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English.

The locals in Prague, universally seem to speak, in this order, Russian, German, English and Czech (some also add another language, either French, Polish or Italian). So many folks, however, seem to have a first goto language.

My point in some previous posts was the contrast between citizens of various countries -- the French were rude (at least some were); initially, I would not automatically assume they would know if we were British or Americans -- all the menus use the British flag to indicate which part of the menu is in English. I don't recall ever seeing the American flag in any country on a menu to indicate English translation here. I rarely told anyone where I was from, unless asked -- which the folks at Oktoberfest in Munich seem keen to know.

I don't think anyone I've ever known who has been to Europe goes there with anything less than a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the countrysides, the diversity of the cities (knowing that they are not 200 years old, but multiple times 200 years old). I know of no one travelling to a European destination, who has anything but a desire for a vacation -- it has never occurred to me to think too much about WWII, while visiting a European country, for instance, other than my trips to Poland (Krakow, Warsaw) where we went to the concentration camps, the salt mines. Then there was the trip to see old Warsaw which was lovingly restored after it was virtually leveled during the war. Even Prague which does have some remnants of Soviet occupation, seems much more of the now, not the then, so to speak.

I have been to Germany and Italy the most, and I have been to German museums which do put history on display -- the good, the bad and the pure evil that we all have learned about. In Amsterdam, I went to Ann Frank's house, which was also presented, er, ""objectively."" Been to Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin, too -- went to the museum, which again put some very unpleasant things on display. But the trip to the Doges Palace in Venice with the torture devices on display, is also quite eye opening.

I don't recall any resentment of the US on display anywhere -- the museums didn't editorialize or express regret, anger or, hmm, je ne sais quoi. I saw nothing that would encourage an American to somehow believe in their superiority. There were, generally speaking, no ugly Americans -- or even ignorant ones as were depicted in the Hepburn movie, set in Venice, ""Summertime.""

Continuing . . .

Took a tour of the Maginot Line, and my tour guide -- French -- made fun of France for ""how you say, a lame attempt to prevent the Germans from invading."" We did smile at his attempt at humor, but again, most of my two dozen+ trips to Europe have been as a guest in the [whatever] country, and I was pleased to be able to be a guest, in fact, I often was humbled by the locals as they were multi-lingual, whereas I was only able to speak a little German (I took lessons for about three months back in the 20th Century). I expected very little out of the local folks I would interact with, other than a certain level of courtesy since they were, after all in the hospitality business; and I did not condescend to them.

Yet, go figure, the French sometimes seemed on the verge of being annoyed by our presence with the exception of those involved with customer service at very high buck restaurants and our hotel, the PARIS - LE GRAND ($500+ per night, 5 stars). BTW, the hotel is an oh wow experience. I loved it, but I would, knowing what I now know, never stay there again (since most of the time we were there, in our room, it was night and we were in the room with no lights on, sleeping; I can find a very nice place to sleep for less than half that amount (often 3 stars), in other words; if my goal was to just stay at the hotel, I might think differently, however.)

Anyway, FN has really come through for us all -- lots of great travel and adventure, great pics and of course some car talk. I, for one, would love to hear more about the car, the driving -- any positives, any surprises, overall impressions, any ""I wish it did this"" comments, etc. It is a BMW, after all, so I would expect it to do almost everything in fine fashion, but still. Hey FN, what features and options did you configure the thing with, and which ones are you most impressed by? Is this your first vehicle with Sat Nav, if not, how is BMW's interface in your opinion?

Back to some travel tips. . .

Far as I'm concerned, Paris should be on everyone's list -- at least once. I've been there several times and despite some surly service folks, I would go again in a heartbeat, even seeing the Mona Lisa, so far, has not gotten old. Darn thing is really tiny though.

France is the only country that acts like this, I speak Spanish, and I sign in American Sign Language, but sorry I don't speak french... If you don't like it, that is your issue not mine. So far the rudest drivers have been the french, if there is a cm of space they will take it, no signal they will just come over. Had a run in with a motorcyclist today, he wanted to cut in, front of me, and got all bent out of shape because I wouldn't back up to allow him to pass... He stood in front of our car and [non-permissible content removed] at us, that was until I got out of the car, he hoped back on his bike and took off, the karma of it was he rear ended a car about 5 cars in front of us, a55hole..."
3903,flightnurse,September 2015,"Mark, the car is basically fully loaded, that was the nice thing about about doing a ED, Now for 2016 BMW has made major changes to the 3 series, but the GT and 4 series car's haven't gotten the ""styling"" changes like the sedan, but other ""changes"" they have. ALL 3 series and 4 series cars come with sport suspension as standard, as well as sport seats, NOW, for some odd reason, BMWNA does not think the north american x-drive cars should have the sport suspension, doesn't matter if you get the M sport package or Sport.. So the trick to is order the Dynamic handling package, and had the same time you can order the M Adaptive Suspension (think GM's magnetic ride.) So with those two options the DHP is only 1K and the M Adaptive Suspension was only $700 your x-drive will have the moves of RWD cars. So with that, we also got the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Tech package (we love the heads up display) Drivers assistance package, Auto High beams, Alarms is standard for 2016. So we have 2500KM on the car, I love the ACC, but I wish there was a way to turn the adaptive part off, here in France if the french see the slightest opening between you and the car in front they will merge right over so the adaptive part of the cruise leaves about 8 car lengths so of course the french moves right in, so what does that do, slows the car down even more, because it now has to leave more room between you and the car in front...

GPS, it's interesting, give you an example, when we left Marseilles for Beaune, we programmed the new hotel into the GPS, We first used the address of the hotel, the GPS couldn't find it, so we used google and found it that way. At times the GPS gets confused (like some women when they drive) and the directional pointer on the Nav screen will just spin around and it's not giving me a direction in which to go. This has happened a couple of time far, I'm hoping that problem will go away once the car hits north american soil..

Lighting package, the 3 series get LED lights, we have Xenon, which are adaptive. The Auto High Beams are nice, I believe I can get the Euro High beams coded in the car, in which one of the high beams will go to normal lights and the other high beam stays on.

Heated Seats, haven't tried them out yet..

Side and Top Camera's, we have a 360 degree view of the outside of the car, cool feature.

Premium Package, I love the Comfort Access, lots of cool features can be coded into the car, but you have to have Comfort access to do it.

So all F3X cars have a toggle switch to go between Eco-Pro (boring setting, it's to help save gas) Comfort, Sport and Sport+, since we have the SAT (Sport Automatic Transmission standard BTW) we gained Sport+. Sport + allows for the some of the elec nannies to turned off or not interfere so quickly. Now my 320 has the same toggle switch, before I got my car ""coded"" to activate the SAT, when I would go from Comfort to sport the only thing that really changed was the throttle setting, it was more sensitive in sport. The GT with X drive handles wonderful, when we were in Lake Como, it was raining very hard, and at times I tried to get the car side ways, had it in Sport and it would not do it.

Sport Seats, I haven't had much time to play with them, they are comfortable but could use some more adjustments..

Over all I like the car, we went back and forth on getting the 328 or the 335, part of me wish's we got the 335i, it's all all about the power..

At the Welt, I sat in the rear seat, MAN talk about room, and the seat in front of me was positioned for me...

We are averaging 24 with the car, which I don't think it so bad since we are averaging about 90 on the highways..

The Drive today was to have taken 4 hours but ended up being 8.5, lots of traffic and a problem at one of the toll intersection...

So monday morning at 0900 on the dot a black Audi A8L pulls up and the driver, David, walks in and introduces himself to me, mind you, never meet the guy before. Introduces himself to Rick, and off we go.







Ok, this is how one travels around wine country in France. David was great, and if anyone wants his contact info, please let me know. He worked in a few wineries around Beaune, knows a lot of people, he was able to get us into all the wineries for free and in before the crowds arrived. Very knowledgeable person and personable.

First up was Chateau de Pommard









The tour was great, we were taken down below where the wine is stored, very interesting and educational.





After aging in the oak barrels then the wine is bottled, then stacked.





After the tour it was tasting time







Don't ask how much we bought... Interesting note, doesn't matter what winery we were at shipping cost to the US was the same..."
3915,flightnurse,September 2015,"Second winery Chassagne-Montrachet

This is a smaller family winery, however, they product some excellent wines.

It was harvest time in Burgundy so the grapes were flowing, we were shown around the winery by the owner and explained the whole process.










So many of us remember Lucy crushing grapes with her feet, well, they don't do that anymore, they have machines for that.





The machine rotates and crushes the grapes and the juice flows down.



Crushed grapes




Jucie from the crushed grapes, yeah look bad, but tasted good. Once they are done crushing the grapes, they are placed in huge vats and all the sediments settle to the bottom, this is done 3 times before the juice is places into oak barrels to ferment.


Here is a map of the area where the winery is at, each color represent different types of grapes, one thing I learned was, the vast acres of grape vine we saw, are not all owned by just one company. The map show inside the vineyards small sections with lines in them, that indicated what this winery owns, as you can tell they are scarred all over the place. This is how it is done in France.




Grapes that just arrived, and was picked about an hour before the photo was taken, yes, they were very sweet tasting.



Father and Son loading the crusher for next batch.






Next we stopped by one of the most famous and most expensive wine makers in the Burgundy region Romnee Conti average bottle of wine from this winery is $300 US. and no we didn't buy anything here..







Next we went to Chateau Du Clos De Vougeot, The Clos de Vougeot vineyard was created by Cistercian monks of Cîteaux Abbey in 12th century, this is the only vineyard that is ""enclosed"" by a rock wall, and that is still intact today as it was in the 12th century. I could go on about this place, but do a search on it, it's an amazing place.









Lastly we went to a very small winery, very interesting concept, the owner build a restaurant underground that features food and wine from the area.





He also has a small collection of ""stuff""



Wine





More stuff




That was it for the tour, we were tired!! Had a great time and the A8L was awesome, I loved the message seat.. Now we get to wait for our wine to arrive.

Lastly off to Paris to drop the car off"

I've never been to Europe, but my wife visited Italy about 3 yrs. ago. Her interactions with the locals were very positive. She'd love to go back. As for the ""surly French"" - I've heard that same comment from many Americans of varied backgrounds who've visited France. My opinion is if it wasn't for Americans like my late father who participated in D-Day they would be speaking German now. And my late Aunt told that to a surly sales person she had an unpleasant interaction with in Paris. God Bless America!!

FN, thank you so much for going to the trouble of posting your travels and pics. Very enjoyable and enlightening.
Couldn't the French claim that if it wasn't for them we'd still be speaking England's version of English?

3921,flightnurse,September 2015,"So we left Beaune Wed morning about 9am, destination, Charles de Gaulle (GDC) airport, most of BMW drop off locations are at airports, we were scheduled to fly out of CDG, but the day before I found a much better flight out of London (Rick has a couple of ex-co workers now living in London) cancelled the original flights now book our new flights out of London Heathrow, all flights were booked on Frequent Flyer Miles, and one nice thing is when you cancel there is no charge, most airlines these days will charge you a ""close in"" fee if you book an award travel with in 2 weeks, however, since I have elite status with AA, that is waved for me.

We super slabbed it to CDG, nice thing about France is speed limit is 130Kph, which is about 80, But like any country people travel faster then that. I averaged 90mph. We arrived at CDG at 130pm, got he car washed, (US customs requires the car to be ""clean."" there is a carwash at CDG, 8 euro later car was clean. Now, if you have been to Paris you know he city is horrible to drive in, and the French are just crazy drivers (really look at their cars), however, the route I programmed took us to the outside of Paris and missed most of the traffic. About 30 minutes before getting to the airport, the windshield cracks, I did not hear a rock or something hit it. Luckily the insurance on the car (that BMW pays for) will replace it. We get to the drop off location of the car, sign the necessary paperwork, and we are done, we say good by to the car, wont see her for at least 2 weeks. Total 3127 K driven on this vacation.




Yes, there is a crack if you look in the middle of the photo




Farewell photo...



The Euro plates will stay on the car when it arrives at the Dealer, and the Dealer been instructed to leave the front plate on (AZ does not require a front plate.)

This trip was about bucket list items, so another one was to take the Eurostar to London, the company that we dropped the car off took us to Gare du Nord train startion which is in the heart of Paris, it was an interesting drive.. We made it in 40 minutes, lets just say the French just do not care who they piss off. We bought the tickets at the train station, and was on board minutes later, we got the last two seats together facing forward. When we got on the train, there was this french women sitting in one of our seats, the business class trains are set up with single seats on one side, and two seats on the other, the two seats are set up to seat facing each other, so two people facing the direction of travel and the other are not. We we arrived, in her very broken English she wanted us to take the other seats, we said no. We knew from the seat map when we bought the tickets 3 people were sitting here, not 4. Come to find out, she decided she didn't like her single seat, plus a friend of her was on the train and wanted our seats. so they can sit together. Now the other passenger arrives (older lady), then the cabin attendant. The single rider (older lady) sits where the young women was to have sat, but she was refusing to move, and wanted us to sit in the other seats. Rick doesn't like traveling backwards. We tell the cabin attended this and we wanted our original seats, the young women speak french (but I think she speaks English too) to the cabin attended, so we end up in this circle of language, I think look at the young women, and said, I knew you speak English, so stop playing games. I was right, she did, so she understood everything I was saying, which really pissed me off. So I told her that we wanted our seats we reserved, if she didn't like then go find another compartment to ride in. She refused to move, needless to day, she won to a point, we were just moved to the Business Select Premium cabin... Like I said before of the French, We can do this because we are French.. It's the attitude that really piss's me off.. Europstar trains and dirty, they are getting new trains, I hope they have WIFI...

We arrived in London about 7pm, Ricks friends picked us up and took us out to dinner, then to our hotel.

Conclusion

The whole trip we talked about how this car will invoke memories as long as we have it. This is really the only way to buy a car, BMW will allow you to keep your trade in until your car arrives, I'm sure Audi and MB will do the same thing. The only difference on our next one, in the fall of 2017, we wont visit to many cities...

I heard the bad news that not only did someone at Audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming S4 with a slushy 8 speed ZF auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option.

If this is true, Audi should really just make the S4 with a CVT and call it a day since that would suit the customers this move is intended to impress.

If the manual was made available, and my '14 S4 was totaled in the near future (hope not, but hypothetically speaking), the lack of a DSG option would make me get the 6-speed manual if available, if I was getting another new S4.

Otherwise, hello Golf R!

With all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?

Given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, I can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 SQ5 (8-speed Tip) and a 2014 S4 (7-speed DSG) in captivity.

The programming of the Tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- I've ever driven. The DSG is the smoothest transmission I've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG could be said to be somewhat like a CVT. Somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""

Downshifting, again, is an area where the DSG excels -- when in full auto-mode ""S""port shifting program, the DSG transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. Only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the DSG is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.

Now, I've driven the S4 (DSG), SQ5 (Tip) and S6 (DSG) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. Again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at Audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a Tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. In short, unless you're really looking for HARD EVIDENCE that the SQ5 isn't a DSG, you might not really notice the SQ5 is not a DSG. Over time and with the availability (as I have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the DSG and the Tip.

At this stage of my own posterior meter, I can tell the difference between the DSG and the Tip -- the Tip, NOT the DSG has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the Tip in ""S"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.

I have not (yet) driven an RS7 -- frankly because I just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if I had millions in the check book to do with as I please). I also don't think an S7 is worth $10,000 more than an S6 just for the body style. But I'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.

I bring the RS7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that Audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed Tip in the RS7. Several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the RS7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the DSG; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the Tip is from the DSG as executed in the RS7.

Under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our S4 and SQ5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""PHLTTTBBB"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in S mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the DSG, however).

Again, were the Audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 MY S4 Prestige 8-speed Tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, I would be a happy man. Of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 S4 Tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a DSG (which appears to be the programmers goal).

I have heard that the BMW implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but I have only heard that the Audi and Porsche implementation and programming of the DSG have few, if any, critics.

What are the Audi DSG transmission issues?

And, why, if the DSG is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the Tip versions as close to the feeling of a DSG as possible?"

I'd agree that Audi's implementation of DSG is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 A3 (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my S4. In D mode the S4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the A3. To me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, I'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such. I have heard that Audi did get some complaints with the early DSG's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like. People didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense. I don't mind feeling the shift under power.

I'm afraid this change has nothing to do with drive-ability or consumer feedback, but simply a bean counter telling Audi they can make xxx $$$ more per car by using a cheap transmission rather than the best but pricey DSG. This bean counter is in for a rude awakening when sales plummet. The new R8 gets Audi's best dual clutch transmission, so they have figured out how to make it work in very high HP and torque heavy monsters.

I think the review above comparing the very good 8-speed auto to DSG will echo a lot of other people's reviews of the ZF-8 speed tiptronic. It is good, but not quite as good as DSG. Progress going the wrong direction. Perhaps the mid-cycle refresh will correct the mistake, or it is Audi's way of raising the carrot to make people purchase the RS4 to get the right transmission.

Nope, @nyccarguy had it right; it was a Lexus RX 350 to clobbered the front right end of my S4. I was shopping Subaru when the wife was looking for a new automobile recently; they lost out to the Golf Sportwagen, with get this, DSG & TDI.

You know, other than the red paint looking terrible in 10 rather than 20 years, I'm not worried about the shoddy repair work anymore. The car has remained uber-reliable other than that one leaky coolant hose someone in Escondido, CA was probably responsible for.

I haven't found anything other than a loose child seat hook bracket cover to take it back in for warranty; I need something else to go wrong so I don't waste my time over a little black plastic trim piece in the back seat. I think at the track the other weekend with temps as high as 109 degrees I cooked the bright red S4 badge paint on the brake calipers, maybe I can claim ""finish paint"" warranty on it and get new calipers They are more of a smokey maroon now; though I haven't tried to clean them.

Being so reliable, I think I'll keep mine until it gives me reason to not do so, especially since it has been proven at least one S4 that @graphic_guy had was troublesome.

3935,breld,September 2015,"As someone who just recently purchased an S4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the DSG, I'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the DSG being so darned good. As others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which I liked. Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding.

At the end of the day, I made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. I appreciate that Audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought I'd take advantage of it. That was a significant reason why I don't have too much heartache over buying a model that I knew would be replaced in the short-term.

I suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. When the S3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the R8, I can't imagine why Audi would choose to offer it on the S4.

In any case, if I were to upgrade to the new model in the future, I don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me. I've had similar transmissions in previous cars (535, X3) and thought they were great.

Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding.

At the end of the day, I made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. I appreciate that Audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought I'd take advantage of it. That was a significant reason why I don't have too much heartache over buying a model that I knew would be replaced in the short-term.

I suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. When the S3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the R8, I can't imagine why Audi would choose to offer it on the S4.

In any case, if I were to upgrade to the new model in the future, I don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me. I've had similar transmissions in previous cars (535, X3) and thought they were great.
Congrats on joining the S4 owner ranks around here. In my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, I""d rather the choice be between a manual or DSG rather than an 8-speed Auto/Tip vs. CVT (for example).

If the 8-speed is a light unit; that's one consideration, but being 8-speeds; find it hard to believe the weight savings came from the tranny. Heard it's 254 lbs. lighter than the outgoing model; that's good progress! However, they made it even bigger, which makes me wonder if they could have shaved an additional 100 lbs keeping it the same size.

breld:

One can only hope you are correct. The DSG, of course, that I would expect would be the latest and greatest 7-speed DSG such as is offered as the optional (to the manual) transmission on the current S4. The press releases I have seen and have translated, however, claim the S4 will have the 8-speed Tip. Current A4 2.0T models come with the 8-speed Tip, but NOT the DSG 7-speed. Now, then, however, therefore, notwithstanding:

The current iteration of the S3 ONLY comes with a DSG transmission -- a 6-speed version. I assume there are factors that impact what is and what can be, but I have to assume the 7-speed DSG is heavier than the 6-speed DSG. What I don't know is if the 8-speed Tip is lighter than the 7-speed DSG, however.

I see no logic (marketing logic, which is as opposed to 'real' logic) in Audi offering US customers the A4 with a 6-speed DSG since most of the A4's sold in the US the past few years have been 8-speed Tips. I assume the number of takers on FWD A4's in the US is quite small, so for practical purposes, I will exclude them from my following remarks.

Many of those in the market (for an Audi A4) for the first time, are probably cross shoppers, shopping against BMW, Mercedes and perhaps even Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. In a world where ""more is better,"" I can only assume a new Audi A4 will receive a ding if it doesn't offer at least as many speeds as the cars it competes with. BMW 3's will soldier on with 8-speed ZF sourced transmissions, Acura will have, what, a NINE speed transmission? Mercedes 7-speed, Infiniti 7-speed, who knows if Lexus will, for the 2017 MY offer 6, 7, 8 or more speed automatics -- they've been having 6-speed units on the AWD versions and 8-speeds on the RWD cars, so, perhaps they have or will soon be upgrading to all 8-speeds or, who knows even more speeds?

The new shopper will HAVE to consider number of gears as a data point and if, for some reason, Audi chose to offer 6-speeds (DSG or not) while the other guys had 7, 8 or 9 speed units, I would think there would be some logic to the buyer saying, ""MORE is BETTER, so Audi is now not at the top of my list.""

I have not seen any evidence, and boo hoo (no sarcasm), it certainly appears that the DSG 7-speed will no longer be offered on the B9 Audis.

The only good news is that the 8-speed Tiptronic hardware and most especially software does continue to improve by imitating the DSG via a very expertly developed shift program. Said it before, I'm at least OK with the 8-speed Tip since it remains the best torque converter automatic I've yet driven.

3943,breld,September 2015,"Just did a bit more research - it appears that the DSG (7-speed) will be offered on the FWD models on the upcoming A4, with the AWD models continuing with the 8-speed. That's according to a Consumer Reports article. I can't say that I've driven a FWD A4 - for some reason you can't find them here in Colorado - but I have to imagine that DSG is a nice upgrade over the CVT.

3944,markcincinnati,September 2015,"My 2₵: The Value of Allure

Our “highways” – well not all of our highways, roads and streets – used to be something most of us looked forward to embarking upon in our cars – even in what for most of us in hindsight were piece-of-crap cars; e.g., my first car – one of mom and dad’s two cars – was an early ‘60’s vintage VW beetle (the thing didn’t even have a gas gauge). Shortly after I got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36HP stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and AM radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded ""up"" (?) for a Plymouth Valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized). This four-door “babe repellent” also had an AM radio, but it was also equipped with factory A/C – which seemed odd for an otherwise stripped of all creature comforts vehicle.

I loved these cars – I knew they were pieces-of-crap, but I blocked that from my thoughts since these cars gave me freedom, tunes (on the AM) and what felt like unlimited mobility to drive from my bucolic and very sleepy, very little town (pop. 2,700 assuming everyone was home) north of Dayton, Ohio, to the big city (Dayton, if you’re wondering is still just barely a city in my opinion). Truth of the matter is that I rarely needed to drive the 50 mile round trip to Dayton, nor could I regularly afford the 50₵ worth of Clark’s premium gas (Clark only sold premium gas at that time, if you’re wondering) required for such an adventurous outing.

Today, in contrast, our highways and byways now no longer symbolize [much] freedom, rather they are often seen as barriers to freedom:

“Well I left my job about 5 o'clock, it took fifteen minutes go three blocks,
Just in time to stand in line with a freeway looking like a parking lot.
Damn this traffic jam, how I hate to be late, it hurts my motor to go so slow.
Damn this traffic jam, time I get home my supper'll be cold, damn this traffic jam.”

James Taylor

When my 16 year-old-self got behind the wheel, it was darn near magical, the car was a mechanical being, to be sure, but somehow I was able to anthropomorphize my steed (really, a 36HP VW Beetle was a steed, no kidding) – it became an extension of me, I was no longer driving a machine, I was driving art, it was so cool it was hot. Crank up the single-speaker AM radio until it distorted and back off the volume a quarter turn and carefully balance the “tone control” to pump out all the bass that piece-of-crap speaker could muster.

Everything was possible.

Now, I have to admit, as much as the VW Beetle was not exactly a babe magnet, well the Valiant was truly a babe repellent, even though I figured out how to double clutch the thing to make certain I didn’t “grind a pound” every time I shifted to first-gear. Even so, the Valiant still represented possibilities and made promises to me (that it virtually never kept, I must admit).

Still, everything was possible (in cars).

Sundays, dad always would say “Let’s go for a little ride”. Off we’d go: Mom, dad and me in the other family car, the ’63 Chrysler Newport with push-button transmission, power steering and power brakes and both front and rear AM radio speakers. This one had aftermarket A/C even though dad bought it brand new from the next not-as-little town over Chrysler-Plymouth dealer. Ah, a big V8 and torsion-quiet ride, big whitewalls, bias-ply tires and full wheel covers – chrome everywhere – bling! Someday this will be mine I thought.

This car would be a babe magnet, I was sure of it.

Today, some of us, probably most of us, have lost that sense of possibility when we get behind the wheel, after all most Americans are getting into appliances, machines that simply cannot be anthropomorphized; and we’re getting to roads that allow movement like a pig through a python. In fact, if the 16-year-old's on my street are any indication, the future drivers aren’t even interested in driving until mom and dad make them by telling them “We’re not going to continue being your taxi service any more”.

Then, the automobile gave us a sense of excitement, perhaps danger (benign danger, mostly, but we certainly thought we were baaaad dudes: ""Man, c'mon let's un-tuck our shirts and put masking tape over the word, 'root' on our root beer bottles"") – a sense that we were darn near outlaws, men (boys, really) without rules, barely a code, to constrain our freedoms. Woo hoo, “We're back in the saddle again”.

Today, we’re mostly left with a deteriorating highway infrastructure that really can be dangerous, but driving cars that are, if nothing else, certainly very much less deadly but mostly without any gravitational pull. The fact that a KIA (fill in the blank) or Toyota (fill in the blank) is quicker, faster, safer, almost pollution free (by comparison), comfortable as can be and will have power everything, possibly GPS and probably AM, FM, and Satellite Radio, plus CD, Bluetooth and iPhone connectivity for the iPod function doesn’t forgive the allure that even in “SE” guise these appliances lack. I mean, really, my piece-of-crap VW Beetle had more allure than many of the things that pass as cars today possess – combined.

Not many of us care either, as a glance or even a stare out of your office window to the highway below can attest. The cars go by and perhaps one in fifty is worth another second or two of your gaze. In a few short years, certainly less than a decade, the cars will be driving themselves about 75% of the time, because no one gives a damn. The cars lack allure. We’re over them. If there were unlimited mass-transit ""tubes"" that you could hop in and out of on a whim, well hell, why bother at all to go for another new Mazda or Chevy or Ford or Dodge (fill in the blank)? Nothing to see here, move along, you’ve got homes, let’s get to ‘em.

Those of us on the entry level (or Premium class) luxury performance board here know about allure – FN’s trip to Europe driving a new BMW (his BMW, not a rental), now that’s what we should all aspire to. We’re again on the precipice. Again? Yep, we’re about to lose something we’ve always had – the sense that our cars are an extension of ourselves, hand-in-glove, everything’s possible (when we're in our cars). Gone, too, is the romance of the “little ride” with our parents or with our children. The thrill (of the next time I get to drive) is gone (one hopes not forever) for many. The romance, nay, the sex-appeal of sliding in behind the wheel of your new Chevy Caprice almost has no contemporary analogy except for those who allow themselves at least a $50,000 car purchase.

Does it really take $50,000 to get allure? And, if so, how did it come to this? My father was a 6th grade math teacher, my mom a librarian, almost all cars purchased were “previously owned” (there were only 2 exceptions out of all the cars they ever bought that I can recall), yet “my” cars, my piece-of-crap cars were alluring, exciting, almost thrilling. I contend it is not necessary to spend $50,000 or more for an alluring car. I also contend that there are few car companies that realize they are killing or perhaps already have killed their future customers' interest in their products by not building alluring cars at virtually every price point. [Frankly, KIA may be one of the few exceptions despite my inclusion re: non-alluring and comments above.]

As a stepfather to a 17 year old, I've found it interesting how the acquisition of a driver's license and a car for teenagers these days seems far less significant (or even desirable) these days. What used to signify freedom and the ability to spend time with friends at times seems more of a chore for ""kids these days,"" who can simply ""interact"" with friends from the comfort of their own rooms via a screen.

And, to be fair, from the parents' point of view, and somewhat dependent on where you live, traffic congestion and road conditions create an environment that certainly makes me uncomfortable sending our teenagers out ""cruising.""

I agree there are plenty of alluring cars at all price levels. In fact, I think some of the most engaging vehicles are in the non-luxury, compact segment. Hence, my recent ownership of a Mazda3, replacing a mid-size luxury car.

Unfortunately, it seems the luxury makes have started reserving the sportier, more engaging experience for the upper-end niche sport models. Whereas previous models of a 328i could provide a very engaging drive (and a manual for that matter), it seems you have to step up to an M3 now to get something as dynamic.

So, ALL price levels? I don't know - I think there's something missing in the middle. Compacts such as my previous Mazda3, a Civic Si, WRX, the BRZ, etc. are certainly engaging. But if you want to combine that with more refinement and some of the luxury trappings we enjoy, you have to step up to the other end of the spectrum. Hence, my replacement of the Mazda3 with the S4.

The thing is, it seems a lot of folks (of all ages) seem to think the market has very few noteworthy cars until the MSRP gets to a breathtaking number.

How is it possible for some to and most not? Perhaps we've come to a place where differentiation is either not appreciated nor demanded by the market.

The thrill (could be) is gone.

That I can go out and get an S4 or something else comparable is all well and good -- but overall the folks today, upcoming, seem to actually WANT to live in their rooms or their parent's basements..

I thought they were just playing games with the emission testing to make them look better, sort of like the EPA gas mileage tests are gamed by many manufacturers. Now it looks like it was an actual scam.

I have always been a vocal skeptic when it came to diesels in small passenger cars and I never fully believed in their ""superiority"" at the first place. Knowing how old diesels behaved, I knew that new ""superclean"", ""superquiet"" generation that we have now, had to come as at a significant expense. Common sense says that gasoline is much cleaner than diesel, yet the claims were the opposite, the numbers did not add up. I thought it was durability and maintenance and there were confirmations from the native markets of those cars, where there are systematic premature failures of double mass wheels, particulate filters and other parts. Essentially, it's been established by now that diesels are not expected to last any longer than gasoline engines as they used to and they actually may last shorter.

Now it looks like it was a big scam altogether. I did not imagine that one. I wonder if European officials will follow and dig deeper into their testing procedures to see similar issues and more than just Volkswagen. It may be a start of something really significant.

The regulators in Europe are two-fold - European Commissions for Union-wide regulations and then the governments who adopt those regulations on their schedule, add something, sometimes negotiate removing or modifications. Then local officials enforce those rules (diagnostic stations, etc.).

From what I read, it's very likely, all manufacturers may have gamed that system over there - VAG may be just the beginning of really ugly truth. I may even pose a small conspiracy theory that many people at high levels knew what was going on, but kept quiet because of carbon emission policies running amok. Everybody wanted to show progress, so they kept blind eye on some things that contradicted official line. There were articles published before this scandal on emission levels in big cities over there and numbers simply didn't add up (the supposed reductions due to better standards, vs. actual levels). The defeat software may be the reason behind it.

Well, yes and no.

1. It was not time to buy banks after first news of big loan losses broke out in 2007. It was just a beginning. You needed to wait 18 months for that to fully play out (March' 09).
2. It was not time to buy when BP platform went down. It took over six months.
3. I already mentioned Lumber Liquidators. The resolution is nowhere near.
4. Same with Target breach. This one was shorter, as more and more breaches came to light and market got sensitized to such news.

It's almost never good time to buy right away after some truly company-specific adverse news with possible long-term consequences breaks out. It takes the market some time to price all the risks, scope the damage, also there will be initially enough people who will try to play it as ""opportunity"" without fully understanding the scope. The experience is, when one big bad news comes, there will be a lot of follow up stories that will create more and more concern. It's only when the pessimism reaches certain levels, way out of proportion to the actual damage, then it's time to buy. Usually months, sometimes longer. There is one important thing - the news must be really significant (potential 20 billion bucks levied by US government is important), legitimate (there are rumours, hoaxes, or embelishments happening all the time) and long-term (""more to follow"").

The market is about pricing today future earning streams of companies and possible risks to them. Most of the time, traders try to exaggerate every day news so they can make a bit of more money. However, there are days, when it may be the opposite. Sometimes, the right thing is simply stay away until the damage can be assessed and pessimism gets too high. Not just yet for VW, IMHO.

My favorite part:

""When the device is not working, and the cars are operating in regular driving, they emit 10 to 40 times more than the allowable legal levels of certain pollutants.

Make no mistake that this scandal is a huge deal. If the EPA’s allegations are true, VW knowingly broke the law with some of their most important products and could face severe financial and criminal penalties. And even in an era of recall after recall, Automotive News puts this well: “Compared with other run-ins between the EPA and automakers, VW’s alleged violation stands out in its brazenness.”

BTW, it seems that the scandal scope so far were the ""miracle"" engines that didn't require AdBlue urea injection systems, an expensive system present also on some of their models, as well as BMW, MB, etc. I remember them boasting how great it was that those engines didn't require those systems. Now we know why.

I can only see it getting worse. Once Europeans officials get the scent, this has a real potential of destroying the company altogether. Considering how many more diesels they sell over there, even much smaller penalty per car is still enormous.

(6) Why didn't the EPA discover it before now?

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency doesn't test every new car for emissions complianceevery year. Most buyers don't know that, though, since the EPA's name is on the official ratings.

Instead, manufacturers ""self-certify"" and submit their data to the EPA. The agency tests about 15 percent of the new cars that go on sale each year, but it simply doesn't have the resources--in staff or in funds--to test every new car.

It's worth noting that in the wake of fuel-efficiency rating reductions by Hyundai and Kia, and then by Ford (twice), the EPA has said it will step up its verification and may require manufacturers to confirm their lab results with on-road testing.

But that's in the future. The VW trickery was discovered by a third party, which then passed it along a chain of contacts until it reached CARB and the EPA.

(We've heard through the grapevine that ICCT shared its results with a Detroit Three automaker, which was actually the tipster to the EPA, but we've not been able to verify that--so treat it as rumor until proven otherwise.)

How is it that with all of the supposed (by me) checks from governmental agencies on both sides of the Atlantic, that this went undetected? Do the respective governments simply take the test data on face value? No random or planned tests? Company says car pollutes this much and it is not validated by any of the hands that the data goes through? Is like a deal where we trust and don't verify -- or essentially trust and allow the company to state its own claims ""as if""?
My put is that the car's computer can tell when it's being interrogated, at which time it switches various algorithms to generate the required results on the reader. While the test is being performed, all is well, and when the test is finished, the ECO goes back to ""normal.""

I suppose it would be possible (and may soon be required) that a tailpipe sniffer be used with no electronic connection whatever, but requiring that would involve government beaurocrats with the ability to figure such things out.

The punchline couldn't have come at a less opportune moment for the German luxury carmaker and its parent Volkswagen AG.

Just hours earlier, VW Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn apologized for breaking the trust of customers following revelations his company cheated on emissions data for nearly half a million of its diesel cars.

The answer is YES. 18 billion is just a potential. I expect that settle at 2-5 billion plus a few scapegoats of middle to high level. The real one is if there is any issue with European market, half of their staff is going to prison. BTW, 10-40 times would probably not pass 20 year standards, so the deceipt is beyond staggering. This is not Hyundai adding couple of mpg, or Toyota overstating the engine power by 5 hp. This is a systematic and brazen sabotage of the system.

What I'm concerned about us IF such a systematic deception happened in other places, then it may simply too big to fail and the whole thing will end in some half-a..d apology and promise to do better.

Maybe, maybe not. Keep in mind that the emissions requirements in Europe are not as strict as the CARB/EPA requirements so under the current tuning, the 2.0 may meet their standards. My understanding is that a new emissions requirement just went into affect in Europe on 9/1 that brings diesel requirements much closer to the CARB levels.

Not that strange. My taxes pay the EPA's bureaucracy, ineffectiveness, and waste.

Without the EPA, seems to me car prices would be lower, emissions would be about the same, and my taxes would be lower. Also, the Colorado rivers wouldn't be as polluted, but that's another story.

This goes to the heart of the gov't doing more harm than good with each department and policy it enacts, be it the IRS, the EPA, the Military policing of the world, the CHP and its traffic enforcement methods, and on an on.

I guess a strong faith to Adam Smith is needed. That said, the integrity of most people in this forum is quite commendable."
3983,markcincinnati,September 2015,"I've been reading and watching the TV biz channels as they pontificate on the meaning of all of this stuff. The current news is that this is a re-run; Cadillac did it (got fined) Ford did it, etc. Apparently 11M (VW's numbers) vehicles had this software installed. Well, Honda got caught a few years back -- same thing.

The list of ""who's done it"" seems to be much bigger than the current scandal.

This doesn't forgive any company -- and it is more serious than Hyundai fudging the MGPs of their cars or Acura claiming their cars had more HP than could be tested, and so on -- but the thing is, I have read (in car magazines) interviews, over the years, from top car company executives who have claimed the MPG and emissions requirements go ""to the practical limit"" of technology then go beyond what is known to be capable for any realistic sum of money.

Nothing said here is meant to forgive the lie.

However, isn't it possible -- in the current climate -- to find some ""objective"" engineers and/or scientists who could say ""here is what we are able to do TODAY at this price; here is what we're able to do TODAY at that price,"" and so forth. I understand if a Martin Winterkorn goes before ""the government"" and says ""this is what is possible at a cost of $xxx per car; and what you want us to do would cost ($xxxx) per car"" the government doubts the veracity of the remarks.

So, the government wants a car to emit this much pollution and go this far on a gallon of fuel (or whatever is used to power the vehicle); apparently it can't be done at a market acceptable price today. Then you factor in that CAFE often gives a pass to trucks, so the mfgr goes ahead and creates a 2-cylinder car with a cardboard back seat, no sound insulation and made with the lightest weight materials -- that are inexpensive -- known to the designers.

I guess it is possible to increase the EPA ratings in all of the good ways by making cars out of carbon fiber and unobtanium, and powering them with a fuel cell and a solar sail -- but, said cars will cost 300% of the traditionally built autos. So, you're $25,000 car will satisfy the EPA, etc, but, it will cost $75,000.

This, if at least in spirit is correct, is unworkable and for most folks unaffordable.

Again, this does not forgive lying, but I can only assume that the corporate thought process, since it keeps happening over and over, arrives at the conclusion that the cost of getting caught is less than the cost of [attempting] compliance. Since the cost of compliance is apparently, like unobtainium, simply too high to adopt.

Too big to fail? Who knows if VW is too big to fail -- but if the death of the VW enterprise is the eventual cost of this transgression and disregard for law, well, ""who's next?""

I would hope the regulated, rather than lie, make a convincing, compelling case in response to unreasonable and/or unaffordable legislative requirements.

Here is what I want: a car that accelerates to 60 in 3 seconds, gets over 75MPG, tops out at 155MPH, stops from 70MPH in 100 feet, holds 5 people and their luggage and costs $25,000. I have to assume this is like the old saw: you can have this product or service: fast, of high-quality or inexpensive -- pick two.

Seems to me the regulatory agencies, the world over, expect it to be ""pick three.""

We're not there, apparently, yet."
3984,benjaminh,September 2015,"According to an article I read somewhere, but can't find right now, someone with familiarity with emissions systems said it would have probably cost VW only $200-300 more per car to make them actually pass the test. Almost certainly they would have also gotten a couple of notches lower on the mpg and hp scales, but it could have been done.

The gov't is not asking for the impossible at this point. About 8 years from now, however, things get challenging with CAFE mpg standards. But with 8 more years of R & D on that front, who knows what improvements we'll see.

Many midsize cars sold for 2016 already meet the CAFE mpg requirements for c. 2021.

3985,robr2,September 2015,"@markcincinnati

Keep in mind that the emission, fuel economy, and safety standards are not decided in a vacuum. Manufacturers and their lobbyists work closely with the EPA and NHTSA to come up with achievable targets. The government knows they can't pick arbitrary standards that would make products so expensive that the average consumer couldn't buy them. It's all negotiated.

As for VW and the inability to meet the target, remember they are able to meet the target when the vehicle is in test mode. I'm guessing that performance, fuel economy, or cost targets could not be met without the test mode, hence the deception."
3986,stickguy,September 2015,"well, obviously they could make the cars pass the test. For no extra money, because they did pass the tests.

the problem isn't that they didn't pass, it is they essentially did a ""cheater"" tune job themselves (as opposed to owners that chip a car to get the same end result).

I assume the ""fix"" is just a flash update to make the test cheater tune the standard and only option.

I admit not having had time to read the articles about this. I have seen the ""up to 40x"" stuff (which i assume is worst case, not close to average). But is there decent reports on what the HP and MPG hit to running the ""test"" tune all the time would be?

I don't even know of any Jettas that, new, retailed for that much.

Anyone who reads and/or watches conventional media knows that so many of these companies that try to get away with things, don't. Therefore, someone who measures risk must have come to the conclusion that the risk (cost) of the lie is lower than the risk (cost) of compliance. Why else would someone make such a decision, especially if the cost per car would be $200 or $300 as suggested here elsewhere?

Another news story claims, that ""as a practical matter,"" (which I assume is code for ""the cost of meeting the standards would make the cars in question unsellable"") there is no CURRENT way to meet these requirements.

Sure, discoveries are made every day, and I think it is reasonable to conclude that it is possible to get to zero emissions -- but diesel engines must make things more difficult and/or prohibitively expensive.

If I thought I could comply and simply pass the cost along to a willing market, why would I risk even the possibility of being caught fudging the numbers?

Something doesn't add up -- I mean why would Cadillac have done the same thing a few years ago, why would the other companies fudge HP or MPG ratings or not fix ignition switches (and in the case of ignition switches there was an inexpensive fix)?

I understand there are EPA haters, and of course there are car company haters, but time and again, when it is possible for a secret or cover up to be discovered, it is -- is, for example, Martin Winterkorn, a boob someone who doesn't read or watch TV where it is possible to see a peanut company exec go to jail for 28 years for trying to cover up tainted peanut butter, or GM being called out for faulty ignition switches or Cadillac being fined for cooking EPA compliance records?

Said it before, the only way to keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead. How many people at VW knew? Did it not ever occur to anyone that a curious guy from the university of West Virginia (or where ever) would test one of these cars and uncover the deceit?

As somewhat of a student of Adam Smith, I'm not really sure if this is the invisible hand at work -- it seems more like the work of a statistician who advised (ill-advised, I'd say) management that the cost of compliance is far more dear than the cost of getting caught cheating.

I just missed what the President of Nissan was just saying in an interview, but it seems to be something like ""we all do it, because the costs of compliance are too dear.""

My issues with diesel, until quite recently, have been the scarcity of gas stations that also offer diesel. Now, I would see only positives to getting one of Audis new high performance diesels (which all require ad-blue).

My guess is that it wasn't ultimately the cost but the performance that was the real issue. It seems like it was probably c. $300 or less per car to meet the rules, but at the same time power would have been down by a bit, mpg would have been down a bit, and heavy adblue use would have raised the cost for the customer, weakening the case for trading in a gas car for a diesel given the premium of thousands of dollars over gas in msrp.

It seems like some people within VW thought the US rules were BS and didn't want to follow them. They wanted their cars to have better performance and better mpg by running their diesels ""naturally."" But the result was that the vehicles put out 5-40 times the pollution that they were allowed to by law. Diesel pollution has been scientifically proven to be harmful to human health, which is why CARB and then EPA established these rules to begin with.

So far it seems that BMW followed the rules, although perhaps that will prove to be optimistic. As a result, if that turns out to be the case, BMW's diesel vehicles cost more and get slightly lower mpg. There were probably people at BMW who cursed CARB as well, just like a few people here are, saying, ""those #&* bureaucrats!"" etc. But then BMW got down to work and got the job done.

Audi, apparently, followed VW down the bad rabbit hole when it came to the diesel A3.

If had to do it all again, the only change I think I'd make is I'd have also bought an A3, in a different color though. Since the wife had a bigger budget than I, the Golf seemed to be the next best alternative to a similar vehicle since one seems to be built upon the other.

Honestly I'd like to see companies that are blatant cheaters to go down HARD. Unfortunately it doesn't usually happen. The big US banks are all bigger than ever and ready to cause a new economic destruction. I'm sure VW won't be hit all that hard. I used to like VW, had VWs for many years, but the combination of parts costs, crappy dealer service, decontented blandmobiles, and now severe cheating is enough for me to never touch them again."

Well, then, if you are correct and it seems logical that you are -- I still don't understand why VW would risk so much for a couple hundred or so bucks increase in the MSRP. Also, the total US number of cars affected is just south of 500K, globally it is 11M. If VW just thought the US EPA was BS, why cheat on the other 10.5M cars?

This, besides being illegal, unethical, bad behavior seems like such a boneheaded thing to have done, it is scary.

Everyone ALWAYS gets caught -- or at least history is replete with bad actors being caught over and over and over again. This current situation is similar to the behavior Cadillac was found to have been guilty of -- in their case the fine was $45M.

My thoughts: if you want a diesel car, you know it will cost more and, generally speaking not have quite the performance parameters we're used to in gas powered cars. Was the fudge factor in these small 2.0L engines so different with the ad-blue technology that folks would say, hell no, this thing's a dog?

Other than pain, suffering, corporate shame and big losses, what could anyone have thought would be gained even if there was virtual certainty of not being found out? Winterkorn, apparently, really must be not too bright and too arrogant by about a million percent."

And, I do agree that we don't know about those who don't get caught -- I should be more precise.

But, there are sufficient numbers that are caught and make the news that there generally seems to be little upside.

Let's just say that VW has to pay $10B, not the $18B figure that is being used by some in the news. After all VW already thinks they're in for over $7B in expenses to get through this. Is it possible that this figure is but a fraction of the cost of not doing the crime in the first place?

There may be circumstances that are what might be called justifications for doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. But what reasoning could possibly justify thinking that this was a reasonable risk?

I keep looking for some logic, even if flawed that explains why any company would do such an expensive and dumb act.

Winterkorn says he was unaware that 11M cars had had cheater software installed in them. How is it possible that this is true? And, unless PEOPLE are punished, what makes anyone think bad corporate behavior won't just keep on happening? And, I'm not talking about the shareholders being the people who get punished, either."

BERLIN (Reuters) -- Two of Volkswagen group's highest-ranking engineers will be forced to quit as the automaker is pushing steps to clear up the diesel emissions scandal, a German newspaper reported.

Audi r&d boss Ulrich Hackenberg and Porsche's engine chief Wolfgang Hatz will be dismissed at a meeting of the supervisory board on Friday, Bild newspaper said, citing unnamed company sources.

Hackenberg, 65, was a long-time VW brand executive, while Hatz, 56, is VW Group's head of engines and transmissions in addition to his Porsche role.

We have a wave of outraged officials all over the world right now. I'm waiting for news that they actually knew about it (at least to some extent), but did nothing, because of their political agenda of ""save the planet's climate by giving everybody cancer"". This may take a while, as those interests are deeply entrenched. It simply didn't make sense to me that suddenly Hans, Pierre, or Giovanni the Public fell in love with diesels, not just cab drivers and fleet managers, even those individuals didn't travel nearly as much as those fleets. Something was amiss . I knew the incentives were in place, just didn't realize how aggressive those governments got into portraying gasoline as source of all evil and diesel as savior of the planet.

It's going to be interesting to watch.
2018 430i Gran Coupe"
4017,markcincinnati,September 2015,"One of the key comments -- and one that I agree with -- is that the advantages that diesel (engines) have over gasoline is/has diminished. The thing is, do we know how much we've seen the gasoline engines catch up with the diesel?

Clearly forced induction and small displacement engines have contributed to this. Now, or at least it would be fair to say ""soon"" we will have the ability to synthesize ""gasoline"" from termite (well sorta) waste and we just keep finding more and more ways to extract energy from the planet in many forms, including natural gas and shale, etc.

I saw another TV show -- which of course means it's true -- that said something to the effect that we have about 99 years worth of traditional fuels -- that we know of -- available to us (at present rates of consumption) in the US.

In 99 years, or even 59 years, I would assume we'll find ways to manufacture or harvest or extract energy from sources that today are too expensive or from sources that we currently aren't even aware of.

Perhaps diesel is done -- but, isn't it true that diesel contains more energy per drop and has (historically) been some 33% more efficient than gasoline. Moreover, with filters and converters and adblue, haven't we reduced pollution? Of course, perhaps this event will mark the turning point for the love affair Europe has had with diesel and the surging love affair Americans have started to have with it.

With the claimed ability to manufacture fuels from bio-substances (garbage, not food, hopefully) and with the claims that we will be able to figure out how to make fuel from water and make it affordable, maybe we've breathed new life into the internal combustion engine.

With respect to the ""reason"" for the lie postulated as ""VW didn't want their cars to have less pep and less MPGs if they had made the cars pollute less, it seems like a reason that still doesn't make sense.

The engines, mostly, where this cheat was perpetuated were the VW and/or Audi 2.0L, correct? Wouldn't it have been possible to apply the pollution corrective measures on a 2.2L engine to keep up the HP and torque and perhaps suffer an MPG or three drop?

Again, this seems like a pressure cooker left alone with the heat on high -- it was only a matter of time before the thing would blow up (spraying beans all over the place). How could anyone think this cheat would not be discovered? I guess I am amazed that it took this long for the ruse to be brought to the light of day.

So now these folks are all getting fired. My take is the people who ordered the cheat and the folks who were in a position to blow the whistle and didn't ought to face some PERSONAL consequences beyond being fired (with some kind of generous exit package one would imagine). Perhaps a ""programmer"" who wrote the lines of code could be spared, perhaps. But the programmer's manager who told him/her to write the code, should be in a ""you are personally liable"" position at least somewhat.

Data point: My Audi dealership is owned by a billion+ dollar company. This dealer group has the Audi dealership and the Cadillac dealership within a few hundred yards of each other.

I did test drive, among other things, a Cadillac CTS when I was shopping for my new 2012 and 2014 cars. I was actually impressed with the CTS, but thought is was, er, mushy compared with the taught German and Japanese cars in the over $50K price range. I did think that once the suspension was recalibrated that the Cadillac could be a real contender. Cadillac must've thought so too, since the pros all seem to fawn over the ATS and CTS cars (appropriately optioned).

So, as I overtook what looked like a ""fake"" CTS this morning, I half expected it to be a kit car -- you know a CTS overlay on top of a LaCrosse or something even worse.

Yikes!

It was a new CTS with a ""Landau"" roof and a bunch of chrome and ""gold"" bling. I assumed this car was a joke foisted upon someone for some unknown and sick reason.

As I pulled next to the driver -- an apparently older American (remember I am one myself) -- I became so mad at the dealer, not the driver, for making this CTS tacky by any 2015 standards I can think of. Can you imagine any Audi, BMW or Mercedes dealership gold plating the brightwork of one of their cars, let alone putting a fake leather roof cover on it? What's next coach lights?

I thought this kind of tackiness was perhaps at least a decade+ behind us.

Are there no ""rules and regulations"" that Cadillac dealers must comply with? I mean it is one thing to see a new Camry or Accord so, er, adorned, in fact, I expect Camry's to be tackily dressed. But, at this stage of the game, how is it that a Cadillac dealer slipped through the time-warp cracks falling back to th 80's or 70's?

I hurled.

I do not fault the senior citizen for their purchase, OK, I fault them a little bit, but how is it that some SW Ohio dealership in 2015 could even think this was a good thing for the brand?

The CTS and even the ATS would have been on my short list based on all of the positive praise the pros have lauded on it. Now, I just can't see myself even bothering to test drive one, knowing that there are such ""super tacky"" versions out there.

At the time (late 2013), I got 6% off of the MSRP of a 2014 S4. My wife also got that percentage off of an SQ5 a couple of months later. These ""S"" cars are usually discounted less than the non-S versions, so we thought 6% off of US MSRP was a decent deal -- and we both got EXACTLY the car that we wanted, not the second color we would except, etc, but the exact cars we wanted.

Now, having said this, does this mean that it would actually be possible to pay MORE for a new BMW purchased through the ED program than it would cost to buy one from a dealer in the US for US delivery?

Small additions/corrections:

1. Only BMW price is negotiable, others are set by manufacturer. In other words, BMW uses exactly the same invoice-to-retail scheme, just at lower levels. I think the difference comes from BMW using dealer same way to purchase the vehicle, whereas others may be using their dealers only to handle the paperwork (and purchase is direct from them).
2. BMW 7% (now going to 5%) discount on both invoice and retail price applies ONLY to the base price of each line (e.g. 328i, 335i, 535ix, etc.). All options (such as metallic paint, premium pack, nav, etc.) are priced at same level as US delivery. Destination charge (BMW loves advertising ""from"" without inclusion of those $900+, like we actually had an option of not paying it - I really hate that, it's unseemly) is also full US level, no discount. This makes the ""blended"" discount closer to 5.8-6.5% for more heavily optioned vehicles - now it will be just about 4-4.5%.
3. BMW DOES NOT include hotel stay, only transportation from the airport to the hotel downtown, or directly to BMW Welt.
4. BMW will feed you over the course of the day at BMW Welt in their cafeteria and you also get a talkien 20 euros credit or so in their restaurant (won't cover full meal, but will be OK to buy something with it).

5. I think Porsche may actually have a surcharge on the price, but I'm not sure about it.


I totally agree - the ED is not about the money discount, it's about the experience. We are still lucky here in the US to get anything. Canadians, or others (Brazilians, Europeans) get the BMW Welt delivery, but no discount.

Best to all current VW/Audi/Porsche customers. Whether you own their gas vehicles or diesel vehicles, reputation is a hard thing to regain once it's lost.
If flying to DC in gross polluting high NOX emission jet planes begging for bailouts for failed business enterprises didn't hurt the Big 3's reputation much, certainly tricking the EPA won't hurt much either other than fines that go into somebodies pocket.

BMW reduces ED discount from 7% to 5%.

Does this mean that the discount that is offered a retail customer will be 5% off of MSRP or 5% off of the negotiated selling price at the US dealer?
Neither. The price is simply negotiated same way as it were US delivery, with ""ED MSRP"" and ""ED Invoice"" values being

NOW:
ED Price (MSRP/Invoice) = US BASE Price (MSRP/Invoice)*0.93 + US OPTION price (MSRP/Invoice)+US Destination (same both levels);

SOON:
ED Price (MSRP/Invoice) = US BASE Price (MSRP/Invoice)*0.95 + US OPTION price (MSRP/Invoice)+US Destination (same both)

Essentially the ED Invoice is what the dealer pays, whereas ED MSRP is what it sounds. You negotiate with the dealer where you hit within that spread. Values strongly depend on markets - some dealers don't even want to hear about discounting from ED MSRP (following theory of always preferring selling a unit from the lot rather than one not built yet). Unlike US deliveries, ED vehicles are not subject to allotments, training fee, or some other fees BMW may charge the dealers. Conversely, ED is not eligible for certain customer cash rebates (the disclaimers often specifically say that), such as those you may get by participating in their ""Drive"" events. I believe BMW Sports Club discount does apply.

At the time (late 2013), I got 6% off of the MSRP of a 2014 S4. My wife also got that percentage off of an SQ5 a couple of months later. These ""S"" cars are usually discounted less than the non-S versions, so we thought 6% off of US MSRP was a decent deal -- and we both got EXACTLY the car that we wanted, not the second color we would except, etc, but the exact cars we wanted.

Now, having said this, does this mean that it would actually be possible to pay MORE for a new BMW purchased through the ED program than it would cost to buy one from a dealer in the US for US delivery?

Or does it mean negotiate your best price and THEN take 5% off for ED?

My experience is that 5% is not all that hard to get from a US dealer, thus making the ED option less attractive with a reduction of 2%.
Mark, the MSRP for a ED BMW is still lower then the ""regular"" MSRP, since the car is considered a used car to the US government and so the tax's are lower.

This is not new, news, I think I mentioned this in one my report. 2% is roughly less then a grand, it's known that 10% off regualr MSRP is the norm for a good ED price."

Which taxes? Surely not my sales tax. Florida taxes new and used car sales the same, anyway, I think. Perhaps you are thinking of US custom tariff, which if true, would make sense. I have no idea what tariffs are on vehicles, as they are generally included in the price of the product and not itemized the same way say state sales taxes are.
2018 430i Gran Coupe"
4048,robr2,October 2015,"My understanding isn't that the import taxes are that much less on a used car, Rather, ED cars do not have holdback on them, don't qualify for dealer incentives or bonus money, and the US subsidiary profit is wiped away since they didn't sell the car. Hence the manufacturer saves those funds and passes that onto the consumer."
4049,markcincinnati,October 2015,"Someone said the dealer would rather sell off the lot than promote/sell a car not yet built. From the time I had purchased my 5th or 6th Audi -- and became friends with my dealer/owner -- he told me he would much rather have only ""test drive"" inventory, service loaner inventory and some used cars. He shared with me that ordered cars have some profit, whereas cars on the lot have less profit. He said he wished US customers were more like European customers, in that they order cars -- dealers are not for the purpose of inventory control, rather they are in the business of demand creation and demand fulfillment via taking orders.

Out of nearly three dozens Audis since 1977, my wife and I have only purchased one car off the lot, and that was a 1996 A6 (that we leased for 12 months) that we used until our 1997 A8 (which took nearly a year from order to delivery) came into the US.

I find buying off the lot to mean one thing -- compromise. You pay more and you often settle for something that is simply not exactly what you wanted.

I don't get the thought process of waking up one Saturday morning and saying to your spouse, ""let's go buy a car today."" Of course y'all must think me daft since I start buying my next car the day after I pick up my latest car -- test driving is a serious hobby for my wife and me, that is. We test drive cars for, perhaps, 36 months then we order one and pick it up 2-6 months later.

It is quite educational -- the test driving that is -- and it is low cost fun, to boot.

Drive it like YOU live (natch)!"
4050,dino001,October 2015,"I agree that your friend store owner would rather his business model changed, if he could, and sell cars from a book. However, the reality of US customer and his/her need for instant gratification (whether it's cultural or induced from the past) and the dealers play into it by holding large inventories. So, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electricity. The calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. Essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock.

Upscale brands are straddling between those big volume stores, where if you say ""order"" you have them running from you screaming bloody murder, and uberluxury, where virtually every car is ordered (like Rolls Royce). They are walking the line between one type of customer, who want a car today and another, who want the car, but can wait, if needed.

Also, some people limit their choice to a color and perhaps couple of optional items (rest is not important), they focus on those plus price, others would rather walk on foot then get a car with a missing feature (or one feature too many).

I ONCE got a black interior (and that was in an Acura TL) because the dealer discounted the car so seriously once he found out that I would walk out rather than have a black interior car. I got rid of this car as quickly as finances and family would allow -- I get inside of a black car and my mood darkens, my optimism vanishes, the interior seems so tiny, hot and constantly dusty.

Yet, you walk into the Audi dealer and there is this beautiful A6 3/0T Prestige, sport package, upsized wheels, and every functional and fun option man or god has created, all for the bargain basement price of $68K and the dealer ONLY has them with black interiors.

Have we become so uncreative, so bleak, so moribund that we can only ""see ourselves"" in black cars, gun-metal gray cars, white cars -- all with black on black on black interiors?

Now, as you know, I resent seeing a $ next to the color -- and ONLY black gloss or white gloss are free colors, but the interior options usually provide several no-charge options at least once Premium Package (which they all have) is included.

My dealer actually, now, has a lot of cars on the lot and on the ""overflow lot"" several miles away from the dealership. But they're all black, dark-silver, gray or gloss white -- most with the dreaded (by me) black leather interiors. Reminds me of:

""And they're all made out of ticky-tacky; And they all look just the same.""

Black cars with black interiors must be the PC equivalent for cars these days -- well except they offend the hell out of me.

Oh gawd, have you, lately been invited to a fund-raiser at someone's country club (with valet parking)? We were invited to a fund-raiser to raise money for inner-city disadvantaged kids; ""business attire"" was specified, so you trot out the dark suit, tie and shiny shoes and pull up to the valet behind a line of black, gray, silver and white German cars (and the odd Lexus or Jaguar) all the while unable to suppress the lyrics: ""And they're all made out of ticky-tacky; And they all look just the same."" It was all for a good cause, but it certainly was a sad indictment of where we've come to.

I keep telling myself that I'll bite the bullet and pay for the paint color next time -- we'll just have to wait and see if I can actually pay extra for a paint color other than black or white.

Hey Dino what is the draw of the M Sport? Currently I'm just looking at a 440i, Track Package, Driver Assistance package, Tech package. The Track Package has the M Adaptive Suspension and for $1700 it's a steal.

Regards to color combo, I'm wondering if BMW is just playing with the web site, since Red was a M Sport color on both the 3 and 4 series. Regarding the Shadowline trim, according to BMW's ordering guide the Shadowline trim was not part of the standard equipment sport, but only on the M Sport, however, our GT has the shadowline trim on it.

It will be similar to daily driving a Hellcat, GT350R, ZL1, R32, STi et al. The difference is the Focus and the latter two shows what can be done with less than 3 liters of turbocharged fury."

I had 2008 STI, it was quite easy to live with and had enough amenities, as long as your lifestyle didn't ""require"" E-class level. I commuted with it for three years - a bit noisy, but generally easy to drive, steer, not too harsh (for me) on the back. As long as you understood what you had, it was fine. I traded for my current 328i, because that's what I wanted - a finer, nicer automobile, with some more ""stuff"", even if (quite a bit) slower.

Sometimes the problem is that image is just tarnished. They're making pretty good cars, but the name says Old People Boats. Hard to shake that.

There's all you need to know right there. The CTS is plagued with quality faux pas. And, they don't come anywhere near the customer service levels of BMW, Benz, etc.

They don't care enough about those issues to correct them, though. They'd rather revert back to ""GM does no wrong"" attitude that they had pre-bankruptcy. They've forgotten we dug them out of their hole and gone back to ""business as usual.""

The $10-15K extra for the Golf R is worth it as compared to the GTI. As someone who threw thousands into a former A3, I should know. You get better brakes, better suspension, better drivetrain and tuning. Most importantly, many of the engine components are beefed up and forged; so you can still tune your Golf R safely to 350 HP +/- for very little money. Whereas running 300 or more HP on a regular GTI by matching the turbo in the Golf R works, but can start to take away your durability and reliability. Also, the R is 3rd generation Haldex AWD.

I guess it all comes down to if you find the current generation GOLF an econobox or not. I found it to be quite well detailed and trimmed inside and out. The chassis is strong, tight, and light. All good things. I haven't test driven the Golf R yet; that's the next step. I'd bet money the rare flaws I found in the Mexican built Golfs/Sportwagens is non-existent in the German built R. Another big-time PLUS for the R in my book vs. other Golf's. That alone makes it not just ""another"" Golf to me.

I will say the DSG in the TDI Sportwagen is lazy. I would bet more money it doesn't have the same programming in the R.

As to what the Golf Sportwagen SE is missing vs. my S4:

1) HP, quickness, and speed.
2) Real Leather Interior (though I like the Pleather VW is using). R uses real leather seating surfaces.
3) It is smaller; though more utility possibilities and flexibility with hatch design.
4) Sportwagen doesn't have Audi Drive Adjustable settings for steering, exhaust, shifting, and other characteristics (comfort, auto, sport), but I think the R does.
5) The hatch doesn't open on its own with the push of a remote button like the S4 trunk.
6) Surprisingly, I think the Golf's do pretty much all have push-button start, rear-view cameras these days.
7) No electronic Parking brake on the Wagon SE (big handle still); though the R might?

I'm sure I might think of a couple other things, but this is all I can come up with for features right now.

4108,markcincinnati,October 2015,"Here's another issue that Cadillac faces: The Auto Mall (AM).

You can go to the AM and in the space of a couple hundred yards (feet in some cases) you can see the Cadillac dealer, the Lexus dealer, the Lincoln dealer and the Ford, KIA, Chrysler/Dodge, Hyundai and Honda dealers. So, you test the Cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new Infiniti or Audi or BMW if you want.

With the MSRP of the Cadillac so close to that of the Lexus or BMW, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given Saturday, Cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued.

I just returned from a 4-day trade show in Las Vegas (at Caesars) and after the day's end I would walk down to the Forum Shops at Ceasars. I found several high-buck watch stores and one that carries many high-buck brands and some less expensive brands, too.

Seeing these watches, I thought about the Cadillac as I looked at the Tissot watch collection and then the Movado watch collection after having looked at the Rolex and MontBlanc watches.

Tissot makes some very nice watches that don't require a second mortgage -- I'd take a Tissot over a Seiko any day. But, once we get to, perhaps, over $1,500 to $2,000, Tissots just seem overpriced. At that price I can move to Movado, but once I get to over $2,000 to $2,500 for them, I start to think, Tag, MontBlanc or even Breitling despite the price jump. Somehow, the $4,995 MontBlanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 Tissot or $2,995 Movado. The Tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.

Cadillac, today, may be Movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end Tissot. For me, that means, if I'm going to pay THAT much for a Cadillac, I might as well get an Audi, BMW or Mercedes -- and if I am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a Genesis starts looking as good as the Cadillac and priced appropriately. Genesis is Tissot, but can make you believe you got the Movado.

Cadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the BMW -- other than the price you are asked to pay.

I'm just not in the market for a $4,995 Tissot.

The malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when Cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced."

I think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of Caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, I haven't checked). Since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make Caddy MORE expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case?

I don't have any Cadillac lease numbers this month, so it's hard to say.

In the past, Cadillac has had pretty low MF as compared to MB, BMW, etc., so that helped on the lease payments. It's also important to remember that other brands artificially inflate the residual to make leasing more attractive - at the expense of having a car worth less than the buyout at the end of the lease.

If you think the lease numbers - especially residual value - are about reality, I'm here to refute that.

BNW has issues with the 550, but the other models are holding better, but we all know that BMW over inflates their residual on the leases. But if you take a M3 and ATS V-Sport I'm sure the BMW will have a higher sale value, the same could be said with the M5 and CTS V Sport."

I do think the M3 does pretty well, but the M5 drops pretty fast at first (new 2014 started at $93k and is worth $68k trade now vs $64k and $50k, respectively, for the CTS-V). I know AMGs suffer. We'll have to see what happens with the ATS-V.

4121,markcincinnati,October 2015,"Most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented. The thing is, part of the formula is based on MSRP -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the MSRP still makes certain calculations limited in outcome.

The good news,so to speak, is that these severely sub-vented leases make it possible to have a 5 series for a mo pay that one would think appropriate for a 3 series.

We did buy my wife's SQ5 and leased my S4; I put nothing down. As she approaches 50K miles she finds she cannot CPO the car, but can buy Audi extended mntce. I, on the other hand, can have my car CPO'd and buy the extended mntce. I'll have both low payments and a 100K warranty and prepaid mntce to 85K. By then I'll own the car outright and likely have been under mntce and warranty the whole time with a payment less than my wife's 66 month finance (which did require a down payment).

It is getting somewhat difficult to come up with a scenario where buy and hold is as attractive as lease and dump.

Our plan, unless new information changes things, is for me to buy my S4 off lease and for her to trade the SQ5 prior to 100K miles.

You know, my company just pays X amount every month for our IBM iSeries computer -- and every so often we get an upgrade to a newer faster bigger model. We'll be paying for the systems FOREVER but we'll always have full mntce and always have the latest and greatest computing power.

Maybe cars are like corporate computers. Line items on the budget -- X dollars per month, which seems to yield bigger and faster at every upgrade.

For $700+ (adjusted to keep pace with COL) per month forever, it appears I'll be able to have a new upgraded version of one of these ELLPS cars in perpetuity. That may seem not affordable at some point in time, and I know that time will likely come eventually.

Is there a spreadsheet (that I don't have to create myself) available (on line) that allows the user to plug in numbers -- and make some assumptions regarding repair and mntce costs -- to come up with the ""cost of ownership"" for buying and holding (at least 5 years) vs leasing (for at least 3 years)? I'd appreciate a URL if anyone here knows of one.

I mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a GM car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80K on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" Pontiac Bonneville was, according to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments. He went ahead and got a new big-boy Dee-Lux CUV (Chevy) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.

He also bought a super-nice Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square. Perhaps Ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.

Took my S4 in for the 35K service interval + a tire rotation last Thursday night; got an A7 with 5K miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (F/R heated seats, steering wheel) and LED headlights. For all intents and purposes, the window sticker I found in the glove box bottom lined at $69K. The option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly Nav and voice command and BT communications and WiFi hotspot were all included. It also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). Perhaps Premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which I thought odd, since there was an A6 Prestige on the showroom floor).

The A7 was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point A to point B. As Col Potter once said, ""there aren't enough O's in smooth to describe it."" Of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as I recall.

The upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option. But I hoped the A7 would be a true Luxury Performance Sedan -- especially for nearly $70K.

In a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime. However, I really could not find much of that German Taught feel I assumed would be present. Oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twisty section of highway.

I had been, previously, loaned an A6 with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the A7.

The thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10K more beautiful than a comparable A6 -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment.

I was able to pull into the dealer in the A7 and five minutes later drive out in my S4 -- the main straight line difference was that the S4 is not quite as quiet as the A7, but everything else about the S4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior.

Now, then, however, would I have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to Columbus, Louisville or Indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the A7 would be appreciated.

I guess the S cars have the power to spoil (me at least). I simply would not pay the extra $13K for a relatively stripped A7 -- and if they were both $57K, the S4 would still be my first choice. Makes me wonder how much better, even, the B9 S4 will be over the A7's.

Well ... yes and no. I just purchased a new ""Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer)"". I opted for the new for this year twin-turbo 2.7L engine, which is entirely unproven. (As to longevity, I mean.) If I had planned to keep the truck ""until the wheels turn square"", most likely would have opted for the old school V8 engine. With this particular engine (the twin turbo), if I were to decide to keep it past end of warranty, I will most likely spring for the extended factory warranty BEFORE the base warranty expires.

Just something about the first year for a brand new engine, especially a ""twin turbo"" design ...

I just got my 35K mile service at 34K miles (did it early). I did it early mainly due to the fact I skipped/missed my 30K mile oil change. Don't listen to Audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5K miles no matter how good the oil is. If you plan on not keeping it much past the 50K warranty, then Audi's advice to do 10K maintenance intervals is sound. Otherwise, the best advice I've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp.

What did your 35K S4 service include?

I told them to include the engine air filter whether it said to do it or not. They also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and I asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when I called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!). Rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use). This time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights), I didn't get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask Audi why the brake pad sensors didn't warn me and to pony up for the rotors as a result Also need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me I was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact. Perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning. Need to follow up with them. My front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).

CR came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable Car brands, and Audi as real-world observance between you and I seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason. Impeccably built, quality controlled, and constructed is what comes to mind as the right words.

I was charged 2.1 hours for 35K service which included the oil/filter, air filter, cabin pollen filter, brake fluid flush, & inspection.
Charged 1.5 hours to replace the front rotors and pads.

The cost of these additional services is minimal and, if you plan on keeping the car beyond 50,000 miles is very inexpensive ""insurance.""

Of course you can elect to keep the 10K interval and for all I know things will be fine -- we have decided at this time we want to be MORE THAN FINE and figured doubling up on the oil and filter changes is worth doing.

We are, too, planning on buying the service packs at 45K which will provide no charge services at 55K and 65K. We will, however, keep up the every other interval (meaning double) practice.

Mine (the S4) can be CPO's prior to 50K miles which will extend the warranty to 100K miles -- my wife's, since we own it, cannot be CPO'd, but we're going to run the risk of something bad happening and go ""naked"" after 50K on the SQ5. The plan, currently, is to trade the SQ5 around 90K, since a BIG HIT in depreciation happens when you drive the car off the lot and again at close to 100K.

We may or may not lease the replacement for the SQ5 and I may or may not buy my next one -- however, at this point, I do plan to buy my S4 off lease.

So why not follow manufacture recommended service? What do you know that others don't?
I know what not one but two highly trusted mechanic's/shop manager's said.

I also know that manufacturer's have a built-in incentive to make cars last as long as the warranty, but no longer. Planned obsolescence forces you to buy more new cars more frequently. This strategy works great except some manufacturer's have the decency to have the experience of their customer's more in mind rather than just the short-term bottom line. Also, a lot of luxury companies still offer either free maintenance, or try to sell discounted packaged pre-paid maintenance. It's a lot cheaper and easier to sell if you can say 50K miles of maintenance, and only have 5 service visits. They only need to make it last the term of the warranty, or the lease. An owner might have other desires and concerns.

They have the ""condition based"" service, which is capped at 1 year. They lowered the mileage cap to 12k, I think. Condition based service is calculated by the computer based on driving severity. The only thing it doesn't take into account is environment. They don't have oil sensors (I don't think anybody does), so if it gets dusty or contaminated, you wouldn't know it.

4146,markcincinnati,October 2015,"Here's my statement: I change the oil, at the dealer, every 5,000 miles. For all I know it is a waste of money, not any real ""insurance"" whatsoever. The 10K intervals are based on several factors, one being that these cars do have large oil capacities. My wife's Infiniti suggested oil change intervals of 3,750 with non syn oil. We changed the oil on that one every 7,500 and used full syn oil.

Maybe this is snake oil, so to speak.

I have no insider info that says 5K changes are necessary. Logic only leads me to the conclusion that 5K intervals cannot hurt and MAY help with engine lifespan.

I really like my S4. There is, at this point, no known US availability date for the B9 S4. I figure I need to keep my current car probably another 2 years. I have every incentive, therefore, to HOLD onto this S4 -- and god knows repairs to German cars are breathtakingly expensive.

So, I figure it this way, ""what the heck, twice as many oil changes have no material downside.""

If you follow the mfgr's representations pertaining to mntce, you are certainly OK within the OEM warranty period.

If the TBN is over 1.5 and wear metals(aluminum, copper, iron, lead) are tracking within about 25% of universal averages(adjusted for mileage) I would think that your oil is probably being changed too early.

As I look at the posts here, I notice there are some of us who have thousands of posts, some have dozens. I could be wrong, but I also assume there are people (and I have been one from time to time) who lurk, but don't post. Moreover, I also assume there are folks who may research (and dream about) their next vehicle using the manufacturer's web sites. The problem with doing that is that those sites are entirely marketing oriented -- there is nothing that could provoke ""other brand (and maybe even other model) thinking.""

This is one of the key benefits of participating in an Edmund's Forum -- you may be provoked.

One of the most popular classes of cars is the class that is discussed in this very forum, ELLPS -- but even within our ranks we differ on what is or is not EL (entry level). I often argue that EL pertains most to the basic chassis (grossly, the ""size""). This means a BMW 3 series, no matter how modest or how out there (in any way you wish to construe this) is an ELLPS car (meaning I would include an M3 unless or until some more granular classification is heartily adopted by folks who flock to Edmunds.)

I found it difficult -- but I acknowledge other's POVs -- to consider two Acura's, for instance, built on separate wheelbases/chassis to be candidates for ELLPS classification. Likewise, I have difficulty considering, again as an example, both the A3 and A4 offerings from Audi to be considered in the same class. Again, my rationale is more size (length and width, i.e.) derived than MSRP or HP or torque, derived. Also, I think a certain Premium-ness is required to be in this club.

Recently, there have been ""trial"" balloons loosed suggesting that the A3 family, now that there is an S3 available, merits inclusion in the ELLPS category. Folks [some] suggest that the acceleration numbers put forth by the S3, since they are a few tenths of a second less than that of an S4, render the S4 a good candidate to be passed over when one is shopping in the over $45,000 category. After all, a balls-to-the-wall S3 can be had for something in the $51,000 neighborhood and a maxed out S4 can command $10,000 more. Why bother paying more is the either stated or implied thought.

Having two late model Audis gives both my wife and me multiple chances to ""legitimately"" test-drive almost every car in the Audi lineup, since they are all in the loaner fleet. I may have mentioned my wife got to be the very first user of a 2016 A8L for 24-hours while her SQ5 was in for new shoes and an all-wheel alignment and oil+filter change. Last week, my turn came in the form of an A7 (which, I must say, I was underwhelmed with).

Couple these multiple legitimate test drives with the hobby test drives we repeat Audi customers are afforded, and you might be able to grant that the missus and I are very well qualified [amateur] Audi experts.

With this as a backdrop, I must tell you about yet another S3 experience we've had and the conclusions that can be drawn vis a vis the S4.

Being quicker to 60mph . . . see next post."
4153,markcincinnati,October 2015,"Being quicker to 60mph

There is a lot to like about the S3. There is a whole lot to like about the S3 if you've not driven an S4. The pricing of the S3 does seem, if you go to a dealer that has both S3's and S4's on the showroom floor, difficult to justify -- again if you've driven (or own, especially) a B8 S4 post 2012, for instance.

I found the S3 to be a bit quicker than the S4 (both cars are equally fast) -- or it felt that way, perhaps -- at the slow speeds. But the S4 with the DSG in ""S"" mode, does seem to be able to get things done in a more sorted, I would say ""better"" fashion; the S4 is noticably smoother and, yes, does things with a feeling that it does have more urge, than the S3. This may be a function of the extra gear, I dunno.

The S3 seemed to dart -- perhaps it seems to ""flinch"" when the wheel is turned. That reaction certainly is indicative of some level of responsiveness, but I did find the S4, even when set to dynamic mode, to be responsive without flinching.

The S3 felt light -- and that is a good thing. But when you close (er, slam) the doors on the S3 (vs the S4), the sound is slightly tinny, evoking some sense that I can only say reminds me of my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance: flimsy. Please note -- I am not saying the S3 is flimsy. It does ""sound"" decidedly less solid than the S4 when the doors are slammed however.

For short trips, the S3 was a blast to drive -- but on the frost-heaved Interstate highways we have here in SW Ohio, any speed less than 80 was choppy, harsh almost. In contrast the S4 at 70 over the same surface just feels solid and ""firm.""

The S4 at any speed under 100 (I couldn't get the real estate to get the S3 over 100 on our crowded Interstates here in Cincinnati) is quieter, one could almost call the S4 luxurious, smooth, supple, etc. The S4 feels like a premium car from just about any perspective I can think of -- while the S3 seems like every surface that you can touch is a bit thinner, hinting at being brittle, in fact. The S3 is made of good stuff, but the stuff feels a bit more economy class, than premium class, however,

The thing is, I do like the S3, but it almost seems like it should have been brought out first (in its present iteration) under the VW logo, rather than under the four-rings.

I took a second drive in a balls-to-the-wall equipped version of an S3 and found a drive around the interstate surrounding Cincinnati (I-275) to be almost punishing -- especially at any speeds under 80. The S3 is a modern day buck-board when equipped with the largest wheels/tires (in summer config) and with the Audi-Drive-Select set to Dynamic.

Yes it is a very high-end go-kart. And, to me, a very high-priced one at that.

My 2014 S4 has its faults -- and it was $57K+, nearly $7K more than the S3, that is -- but the S3 needs to go to finishing school to shed some of its harsher edges. Hell, it can even keep some of the ""boy-racer"" characteristics, since I am of the opinion that I don't want the S3 to be a substitute for an S4, anymore than I want the S4 to be a substitute for an S6.

The S3 may be -- in fact the statistics seem to say that it is -- quicker than an S4 (not faster, quicker), but I am not looking for Audi to produce a WRX or WRX STI (not that there is anything wrong with those Subaru models). I am looking for Audi to produce and market Premium and even perhaps Super-Premium Luxury Performance cars.

In some respects the S3 doesn't represent that ideal as much as the marketing materials proclaim.

If you have an S3 and love it -- I congratulate you and do understand how you could be justified in feeling that way.

This long-time Audi maven, however, thinks the S3 should be sent, IMMEDIATELY, to finishing school or that the price should be cut about 15%. Being quicker than an S4 just isn't enough.

4154,tlong,October 2015,"When I sat in the A3 sedan, it felt kind of like a ""nice car that was cheap"" if that makes any sense. (referring to quality as opposed to price). My 1998 A4 was about the same size as the current A3 sedan but the older A4 was a much nicer car inside.

Alternatively, when I sit in something like a current Mazda 3 that is loaded, it feels like a ""cheap car that's really nice"".

I actually think I prefer the latter. So I get what you are saying about the S3 vs. S4. It's not just about speed, it's also about quality and refinement.

People who want speed, alone, can get a Mustang or a Subaru WRX and forget the refinement. Supposedly you go to Audi for some luxury and refinement as well. So yes, the A3/S3 seems a bit like a cheapening of the brand, just like the new baby Mercedes. Moving downscale to try and get a different audience, but in the long term do these types of vehicles damage their brands, and are they really luxury (even entry level) any more?"

The flip side argument about refinement and cheaper feeling S3 is that $7K ain't chicken-feed, so the delta in cost has to come from somewhere, no?
Point taken, but my sense is that the S3 was, much more of an economy class vehicle -- hence my remark that this freshman effort might have been better if it had come out from the VW side of the house. Even a sub-$50K S4 has a substantially more solid feel; and the look at the interior one enjoys and can touch and feel from behind the wheel is, well, Premium.

I like the phrase: ""cheap car that's really nice"" -- unfortunately, I can't say I thought the feel of the S3 was in keeping with the rest of the Audi lineup we get here in the US.

I read an article about the ways mfgrs approach cutting costs -- one of the mentioned ways was that a car company can elect to make the surfaces you see, but don't touch often, much thinner or with a lower grade of whatever material the surface is made of; also the ""glove box"" can be made of a cardboard like material and so forth.

The S3 seemed much more like every ""trick"" in the book to drive cost down was used, much moreso than the other Audis and BMWs we have had since 1977. My 2014 S4, by contrast simply feels more substantial.

Now, then, I have not seen the upcoming B9 A4/S4 family coming in 2016; and, it is possible, certainly, that it may have adopted the wring cost out ""attitude"" the A3 family seems to have embraced. If so, more's the pity.

Also, the new ""el cheapo"" economy Mercedes (below the C class) seems, too, like a cheapening of the brand.

For these companies, I would suggest they look at a similar (failed) attempt to bring out ""lower cost"" representations of the brand by BMW.

I think I, too, would rather have ""a cheap car that's really nice"".

Perhaps Mercedes can't bring out a non-Mercedes brand, ""economy car,"" but Audi, I think, should have brought out the A3 as a nicer VW than a not-as-nice Audi.

In our market, Toyota got it and came out with the Lexus brand, Honda the Acura brand and Nissan the Infiniti brand. For years, too, GM saw the market approach that seemed to work was to ""always have another brand to aspire to"" starting with Chevy and topping out at Cadillac. I understand the Buick Regal GS is a very competent, ""nice"", car -- but I also believe GM doesn't have, in the Regal, a Cadillac ATS clone.

When the accountants (so it was said) started to rule the day, we started seeing badge engineering -- and while platform sharing does make some sense, taken to extremes, it can also sound the death knell for a previously great brand. Does anyone here really care that Ford dropped Mercury a few short years ago? There was, really, nothing special about them compared to their virtual twin Ford models. There was a time, however, that Mercury was different, some would say special, more special than a Ford.

Lincoln is probably still on the endangered species list for similar reasons. At least Cadillac, to name one, has differentiated itself from Chevy and Buick. Had it not, we could very well have started carving Cadillac's tombstone.

Mercedes and Audi, for example, may have started on a slippery slope as my attorney friends like to say.

I think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example: Tissot makes/markets watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces.

It is possible to pick up a ""higher end"" Tissot with about every modern watch feature and function (complications) known to humans -- and the thing will cost hundreds of dollars (and is often discounted on top of that).

It is virtually impossible to pick up a ""lower end"" Breitling that has only a date a sweep second hand function for under $2,000. Far as I know they both will tell time equally well and both will last for decades, lifetimes even.

Tissots, even ones studded with diamonds, are not considered high-end watches. A watch super-store such as Tourneau sells Rolex, Movado, Tag and also sells Bulova, Seiko and Tissot -- if a Tourneau outlet is near you, check out the brands, perhaps you'll see what I'm referring to. The Rolex is to BMW as Seiko or Tissot is to the Genesis. The market perceives what it perceives. And in the instance of BMW vs Genesis like Rolex and Seiko, ""Perception is Reality.""

Dimensions, decibels at 70MPH, number of speakers in the sound system, suppleness of ride or even country of origin doesn't change -- or hasn't thus far changed -- the reality that the Genesis is not currently considered an LPS vehicle; indeed, it is also not, yet, considered an ELLPS vehicle.

It, the Genesis, is a ""cheap car that's really nice""[sic].

Similarly, the Toyota Avalon isn't a Lexus -- probably for the same perception reason. My feelings of consternation regarding the A3 vs the rest of the Audi lineup (or, similarly, the entry level Mercedes vs the other Merc's) still stands. Likewise: My belief that Tissot makes timepieces that equal Breitling's products, insofar as their ability to keep time, also stands -- but I don't for a minute think that Tissot or Seiko, etc, are high-end Premium watches.

Genesis' cars, no matter how feature laden, no matter how statistically similar, etc, are not in the same class as BMW's. The market's perception, not mine, not yours -- currently indicating BMW is LPS and Genesis is not -- is reality.

Maybe there will be a reversal of fortune for both of these successful companies -- thus far, there is scant evidence of that. Perhaps, however, Genesis will -- eventually -- come to be perceived as a Premium Car.

4173,breld,October 2015,"My wife got her S3 this past August and absolutely loves it. For her, it was about getting something with much of the ""character"" of the GTI she traded it in, but in a package that was more refined and mature. The S3 may feel rougher than an S4 (more on that below), but I would say it's much more refined than, say, a WRX. No doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a GTI, WRX or certainly a Golf R, the premium for the Audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us).

Now, I was impressed enough with her S3 that I returned to the Audi dealership and bought my S4 a few weeks later. And, after a few months of driving my S4 and having ample seat time in her S3....I'd agree, for the most part, with @markcincinnati regarding the difference in luxury between the two.

In fact, and I posted this on the CCBA forum too, this S4 may be my favorite car I've owned. The balance between the sporty dynamic and luxury is impressive. To me, it feels like it falls in between two of my previous cars - an e90 335i and an f10 535i, offering most of the comfort of the 5 and most of the sport of the 3. Sort of a Goldilocks ""just right"" choice.

I had debated between the great DSG and the manual, but in the end, I figured if Audi was still gonna offer the manual, I was gonna stick with they dying breed. And it is a great manual trannie - very ""easy"" to drive in traffic and for me, really adds to the overall experience. Not that there aren't times in my long work commute that I would prefer a nice auto, but I'll take advantage of it now while it's still being offered - doubt it will be for much longer.

Very nice vehicle to be sure and enjoyed it for awhile but it just was a bit too big for me so just over a year later, swapped it out for something smaller. Wanted an A3 like the wife had bought the week earlier but didn't have the $ for one so got a very similar driving vehicle in my VW Golf. Perfect size and fun to drive plus I feel like I've got a 3/4 A3 so all is good.
Luckily, I don't worry or care about what others think about what I drive or where I live. Sure I would've liked to have bought a nicer vehicle like the A3 but didn't want to live beyond our means like so many folks do and I drive too many miles to lease.

The cars we like are liked by us, because WE like them, not because we might have to explain to our buddies that we're driving a Genesis made by Hyundai -- or a whatever made by whomever.

My thesis was simply, don't change the brand. The downmarket Rolex is NOT called a Rolex -- I simply don't think an A3, TODAY, or the CLA, TODAY, should be Audi branded or Mercedes branded. Maybe these models will rapidly rise so as to fit in the family.

At this point, if I can get my hands on a new S4 in a year or two -- and it has not been pushed down in some way -- I really don't mind the A3/S3 being what I think, TODAY, should be a member of the VW family.

Evenutually, however, if the A3 foreshadows a decline, well, I may have to reconsider.

I looked at some ""high end"" KIA's today. They are feature rich and very attractive,. They seem high value -- a nice, no very nice, cheap car.

Funny, that's also what I see with TRD. I wouldn't pick that! (not that I want a pickup anyway).

In regards to my original Mazda 3 comment, I'm just kind of a value buyer and to me Mazda is what Honda used to be - sporty and high value. To me a fully loaded $30K or so Mazda 3 (what I categorize as ""a cheap car that feels nice"") would provide the driving dynamics and still luxury interior and features that would be more pleasing (to me) than a much more stripped A3 at a similar price that is ""a nice car that feels cheap"".

I've owned an Audi in the past and to me the A3 is just a bit too downmarket for the brand. At the time I bought my A4 with a 6 cylinder, sport package, manual tranny, in 1998, the A4 was the ""value choice"" as compared to the BMW 3-series of the day. Having gotten that out of my system, next car I get doesn't need to have that badge any more.

To be fair though, the overall interior quality is inferior, in some measure, to the A3/S3. The Mazda is certainly on par, if not superior, to its peers, but you are indeed getting something for the extra cost of even the entry-level Audi.

We are in agreement. The badge does add some cost, but there is some justification behind it, such as materials, build tolerances, engineering.

Drive wheels - Civic is FWD; BMW is RWD

Anything else?

I've always wanted to own a luxury (or ""prestige"") make, but I'm finding it harder and harder to justify the $5-10-15K premium when the driving experience is really pretty much the same.
Honda is good on safety, but if I was forced to have a head on collision between the 320i and the Civic, I'd choose the 320i for my bones and body. How about you? Be honest.

My wife got her S3 this past August and absolutely loves it. For her, it was about getting something with much of the ""character"" of the GTI she traded it in, but in a package that was more refined and mature. The S3 may feel rougher than an S4 (more on that below), but I would say it's much more refined than, say, a WRX. No doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a GTI, WRX or certainly a Golf R, the premium for the Audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us).

Now, I was impressed enough with her S3 that I returned to the Audi dealership and bought my S4 a few weeks later. And, after a few months of driving my S4 and having ample seat time in her S3....I'd agree, for the most part, with @markcincinnati regarding the difference in luxury between the two.

In fact, and I posted this on the CCBA forum too, this S4 may be my favorite car I've owned. The balance between the sporty dynamic and luxury is impressive. To me, it feels like it falls in between two of my previous cars - an e90 335i and an f10 535i, offering most of the comfort of the 5 and most of the sport of the 3. Sort of a Goldilocks ""just right"" choice.

I had debated between the great DSG and the manual, but in the end, I figured if Audi was still gonna offer the manual, I was gonna stick with they dying breed. And it is a great manual trannie - very ""easy"" to drive in traffic and for me, really adds to the overall experience. Not that there aren't times in my long work commute that I would prefer a nice auto, but I'll take advantage of it now while it's still being offered - doubt it will be for much longer.
How many miles have you racked up on the new S4? There's been reports the engine really kicks it into gear once broken in at 1,000 and then again at 5,000 miles?

The main thing I've noticed is the S4 has long legs. Whereas the 2.0T starts to run out of steam at 90 MPH, the S4 will get you to 120 MPH + in not too many heartbeats.

I'd say there is a very distinct feel between something like a 1.8T A3 and the Mazda 3s. And I'd add the 1.8T, in most any of the applications, feels a bit more upscale. Having said that, I still chose the Mazda3, whatever that's worth.

4209,markcincinnati,November 2015,"Why Drive ‘All-Wheel’ drive cars (that have automatic transmissions)?

Those of you who have, er, suffered through my 5,000+ posts over the past years know that I am an advocate for – some might even say obsessed with – quattro, X-drive, 4Matic, SH-AWD, 4Sure-4Sure, etc. drive trains. Several folks do adamantly oppose all-wheel-drive, favoring instead rear-wheel-drive (and only rarely favoring front-wheel-drive). Likewise some folks are seemingly violently opposed to any transmission that lacks a clutch pedal, regardless of the tonnage of empirical evidence suggesting some clutch-pedal-less models actually outperform those with a clutch.

Not long ago, I was one of the Luddites who bemoaned the death of the manual transmission cars – now, however, with both my physical skills and reading habits apparently still at peak performance, I hereby concede the 7-spd DSG transmission (and its shift programming and ability to ‘learn’) offered by Audi (and others) is superior to even the best 6-spd manual I’ve ever had the pleasure to have known.

But what I’m on about – in the majority – today is the darn near universal adoption of all-wheel-drive as either literally or virtually standard on the premium cars we opine about here: Acuras, Audis, BMWs, Cadillacs, Infinitis, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvos. As a practical matter, here in Cincinnati at least, it has become increasingly difficult to find just about any model from these manufacturers that aren’t ‘typically’ stocked almost exclusively in its AWD configuration. Cincinnati generally does not have much in the way of snowfall, so I find it hard to believe this phenomenon (the explosion of AWD premium vehicles) is unduly influenced by our winter weather (which produces some, but not much, cold and snowfall.)

The, um, ‘purists’ decry AWD’s weight penalty, added complexity and cost, and seem to associate the addition of AWD to a BMW (especially) or Mercedes (or Porsche) as akin to the brand publically emasculating itself with a rusty razor blade. To these folks, well, “It ain’t a purty sight,” to watch their beloved RWD stick shift wielding brands eschew everything that made them special.

Horse-hockey!

First off, let’s stipulate we’re (I’m) talking about the cars we can buy to drive on the public streets, roads and highways almost exclusively. This means I’m not going to presume you’re shopping for a new BMW or Cadillac or even Mercedes C class in the $50,000+ range so that you can drive (your new machine, your personal means of transportation for the things you do in your life) from the dealer to the race track or drag strip (if such things – ‘drag strips’ – have somehow managed to stay off of the politically incorrect list and, of course, still actually exist outside of an historical reference) as if such activities are de rigueur.

No, what I’m on about here is our everyday (and every weekend) cars – no matter that they may be some form of a Luxury Performance Sedan (brand and model) configuration.

In order, I say, you’re better off with (in order) an AWD, FWD and finally RWD vehicle – generally speaking. Yes, there are activities and (mere) moments where your beloved RWD may demonstrate its superiority over the other drive line configurations. But, from a practical perspective, RWD for most folks is the ‘least-best’ configuration if you actually buy your car to drive (principally, primarily – or virtually exclusively, that is), year ‘round on our public streets, roads and highways. Conversely, AWD is the best configuration you can employ to navigate our public streets, roads and highways.

Now, thanks to Bing and Google, it is possible to find apparently endless studies, tests, opinion pieces, essays and love letters for your favorite set-up. However, what does appear to be happening (again) is what was once (in the early 1980’s) referred to as the time between the parenthesis, the time between eras. In the context of both ‘Megatrends’ (the book I am referencing) and the number and location of a car’s driven wheels (and manual transmissions, to a lesser extent), ""[Some] are clinging to the known past in fear of the unknown future.""
Believe it or not, over five years ago, in the March 24, 2010, edition of the Wall Street Journal it was written:

“Rear-wheel drive may not even be that important for some of BMW's new customers. Mr. Reithofer (then BMW AG’s chairman) told analysts. . .that BMW had a survey that found 80% of the customers for the BMW compact 1 series, which in Europe is sold mainly with four-cylinder engines, didn't know it was a rear-wheel drive car.”

The same 2010 article concluded: “The truth is that most drivers probably can't tell whether they are driving one kind of car or another. As technology narrows the performance differences, ""luxury cars don't have to be defined by which ends drive them.""

On-line comments posted in response to this article included:

""I grew up driving RWD cars in the snowy mid-west. I can tell you FWD cars take all the fun out of winter driving. My first experience was with a rented Toyota corolla near Vail, CO. With a foot of fresh snow I was able to easily maintain 55 mph, with the car tracking like a champ. Any RWD car would have been in the ditch over 35 mph.""

And so it goes.

RWD may – but it is increasingly difficult to prove – offer that certain je ne sais quoi, a ‘quality or trait that cannot be described or named easily.’ But technology has virtually wiped out the recognizable differences and, I would argue, has – in the best configurations such as those offered by many premium auto manufacturers, literally wiped out the unrecognizable (some would call them measurable) differences.

Still, some (or many depending upon your bias) front-wheel-drive cars suffer, at least somewhat, from the reputation as being unexciting to drive.

Maybe, like so many other things (or everything else?), it’s all about ‘da money’ – FWD is cheaper to make, provides better packaging and can also provide lower emissions and higher MPG’s. Yet, with the apparently relentless increase in the up-take of AWD cars, CUV's and, of course, SUV's, that may not be true; it may be that the market [you and I] simply perceive AWD to be the best (and remember perception IS reality)!

Then, when the market (aka ‘you’) do finally get yourself to the point of either wanting better and better performance, or perhaps wanting the Ultimate Driving Experience, you end up in a top o’ the line 3, 5 or 7 series – with X-drive, natch.

Nothing even comes close to a fine fine German AWD sedan (as we discuss them here, classified as either ELLPS or LPS cars).

RWD (like the manual transmission) is rapidly becoming an historical footnote – far as I can tell, most Millennials have AWD or FWD vehicles and can’t even drive a stick.

Of course, if they're driving a DSG equipped car, they are almost certainly shifting better than you or I, on our best days, can shift a stick.

. . . and then you die.

4212,stickguy,November 2015,"Sandy, in theory it is not the same engine. mostly the same, but Audi may be tuned differently, which could explain the different feel, and premium. But, more likely it is just that the Audi has more sound insulation or some such. Check the specs on the 2 cars. see if output is any different (peak HP/torque, at what RPM). if they are the same, probably just psychological ploy, since premium buyers expect premium fuel!

I had this issue with my RDX. Same engine family as IIRC the Accord (only the last letter was different). Had almost identical (within 1-2) ratings both ways, at the same RPM. I could find no difference that meant premium recommended on the Acura but not the Honda applications.

Given that Mark and I live in the same area of OH (Cincinnati and its 'burbs), I concur, we get little in the way of snowfall. When and if we do get it, it's either a dusting, or a BIG snow storm. I have a snow blower. I've gone 2-3 years sometimes without using it.

So, why the AWD in ELLPS? Must be a ""tick box"" for the upscale brands, particularly once they cross that $50K threshold. Personally, I would have no issues going RWD...matter of fact, I had done so for years with no ill effects. But, there's a perception around here....you pay that sort of money, you better get all the manufacturer's tech/features that come in their play book. AWD is one of them.

All that said, AWD mechanisms have become pretty sophisticated (everyone has a version of torque vectoring these days), and effects handling in a very positive way. Plus, the days of yore, when AWD systems were big, clunky and heavy, have passed. They are now controled by computer, using light(er) weight materials and seem to be fairly robust and reliable.

IF it weren't for the enhanced handling of the Torque Vectoring AWD systems today, I'd probably look to buy my cars in warmer climes where I could find RWD examples to buy, and drive them up here to park in the GG estate.

The problem is that Hyundai won't be putting the ""Genesis"" brand into their own stores. It will be more like Scion - a corner of an existing Hyundai store. Not sure if they are forcing the dealers to upgrade their facilities if they want to carry the 'brand', either.

My Hyundai store does the most volume in the state, but the facilities - both sales and service - are a bit shop-worn. Not sure you can provide a ""Lexus-like"" experience that way.

4222,markcincinnati,November 2015,"I read the test report of the new Genesis 5.0 sedan in C&D, and, mostly, the report indicates the Genesis 5.0 Ultimate Super-duper bla bla bla could be considered to be a lot of car for the money (and the handling issues seem to have been largely erased, to boot) -- if it were a Mercedes E class. The issue is that certain less than impressive feeling of going into the dealership and seeing the $50K+ Genesis alongside some lesser model priced (via lipstick painted on the windshield [very claaaasssy]) well below $20K.

At least the A3's seem to not be THAT out of character next to the A6's over at the Audi dealer.

And, as was mentioned above, the service department at the Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealerships are brilliantly lit and hospital surgical suite clean (or so it seems). But the Hyundai service bays, while probably competent don't look like places I'd want to walk in/on in my Cole-Haan's.

The whole ""Genesis as a brand"" vibe, currently, needs a refresh. At least the brand -- naming -- will be undergoing rationalization, à la Audi, BMW, Cadillac and even Infiniti (mostly), etc.

Now, then, speaking of VW, the new VW stores have very nice service departments and waiting rooms -- perhaps not quite up to BMW or Lexus standards, but close enough for Jazz. Of course we have a Lexus dealer that has a big buck chandelier hanging prominently in the customer area; and, we also have a Chevy dealer with a huge ""wall of fire"" fireplace in it as well as a sort of mini Chevy museum inside the customer area. Go figure.

Nevertheless, there is something about the Genesis line that I believe foreshadows a serious threat to the high-zoot Europeans. And, I like that -- keeps them on their toes.

At this point, though, I agree with those who find the juxtaposition of the Genesis line with the Hyundai line somewhat difficult to swallow.

I think that is one of the issues that Ford has with Lincoln. A lot of Lincoln dealers are included with Ford dealerships and not stand alone. The Ford dealers around here are pretty generic and don't provide that special atmosphere and experience that luxury buyers seek,
Around here, they forced the Lincoln dealers to become standalone several years ago. Plus, they closed some, too. So, maybe closing some of their stores allowed the stand alones to harvest more customers and be able to make it on their own.

4230,circlew,November 2015,"Oil change costs may be headed for steep drop

Motor-oil maker Castrol, a division of BP, recently claimed its technicians have achieved a breakthrough in engine-lubrication design that makes it easy to change the oil in a vehicle in as little as 90 seconds.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/11/07/oil-change-costs-quick-lube-castrol-nexcel/74615512/

Regarding oil change intervals:
""Improvements in the quality and durability of modern oil have removed the need to change it at 3,000-mile intervals,"" Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer said in an email. ""Consumers are wasting their time and money if they change oil with less than 5,000 miles on it.""

Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland said ""engine technology has evolved so the engine runs cleaner and oil last longer, allowing for more miles between changes.""

Many vehicles can travel 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 or 15,000 miles before needing an oil change, according to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery. To be sure, however, AAA recommends checking your oil level once a month to ensure smooth operation.

Drivers should check their owner's manuals to see when the manufacturer recommends getting an oil change. Many vehicles from the 2000 model year and newer can be checked here: /www.calrecycle.ca.gov/UsedOil/OilChange/FindInterval/."
4231,robr2,November 2015,I had read about that new system from Castrol on another forum. It's a great idea but it will require the commitment from an automaker in order to get it started. Who will be the first?
4232,stickguy,November 2015,"interesting. but probably not as great as it may seem. First of all, hard to see it being cheaper overall, since you still have to pay for the oil, and the contraption.

plus, to get a 90 second change, you are giving up key parts of the process. That is, inspecting the underside of the car, and checking all the other fluids, air filter, etc. That is the biggest part of the infrequent service, which tends to be generically referred to as an ""oil change"".

heck, the changing the oil part of it probably only takes 5 minutes or less. Drive over the pit, pop the hood, remove filter, put on new filter, put in oil, drive away. Oh, remember to close hood!

does look like a slick system. I assume the filter is all built in (but can you top up the oil level in it?). Could also have advantages in packaging, if it works like a dry sump so no oil pan needed? Would have to see a better description of it.

but purely in terms of changing the oil, I still want every thing else checked at the same time. I can spare the 1/2-1.0 hours once a year!
2020 Acura RDX tech SH-AWD, 2023 Maverick hybrid Lariat luxury package."
4233,markcincinnati,November 2015,"Our experience with Acura, Audi, BMW and Infiniti over the past decade+ is that the oil change includes an inspection, report and other fluids top off; also included is a wash and vacuum. Tire pressure, too, is checked and set and sometimes tire rotation is part of the deal.

We drop the car off at 6PM, pick up the loaner and come back the next day at 6PM and pick up the car; conversely, if you don't want that level of involvement, you can opt for the dealer to come to you, pick up the car, leave a loaner and return later with your car, all services accomplished.

90 second oil changes seem like something you might want on your car once the od shows in excess of 50,000 miles -- MAYBE.. My opinion is that I want to visit the dealer for the above noted services even after the warranty has expired.

Of course, THIS TIME, my grand plan (?) is to ""CPO"" my own car (at the dealership) which will extend the factory warranty to 100,000 miles. This ""experiment"" also includes buying two ""service packs"" which will take the factory mntce program to 85,000 miles.

My wife's 2014 SQ5 just hit 49,900 miles -- and we're going to ""run naked"" on this one -- thinking we'll trade it in sometime shortly after it crosses 90,000 miles, since there seems to be a huge resale drop in value at about 100K miles.

This is all new territory for us, since her SQ5 is the first car we've owned since 1977.

Correct. Dry sump and the oil filter is integrated. As for the underside inspections, that can still be done as part of a service.

A major benefit is the ability to recycle the system. The used units and the oil are returned to Castrol and they in turn would ensure the oil and the components are disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. Of course, Castrol has a business angle as well. Since they own the patent, any vehicle outfitted with Nexcell would have to use this cartridge."

And, VW already has a luxury brand - Audi. Still don't understand what they were thinking bringing that to the US. Or anywhere, for that matter.
It was simple, VW wanted to let buyers know that their cars are just as good as those other premium brands. Look at their product back then, the passt was really high end as far as fit and finish, and materials used, but it also was more expensive then the Camry's and Accords too. But we know that the upscale of VW failed and the bean counters got a hold of the cars, the new passt is nice, but no where as nice as the previous gen. The Golf feels upscale and some of the materials used is nicer then what one would get in Sentra or Corrola but those cars have more standard equipment then the Golf.

Rick would get calls from the Hyundai deal to come and trade in his Genesis and the salesman would give him the big pitch about how Hyundai has made strides in quality and refinement. On one of his secret shopping assignment we went to a Kia dealer to look at the new (then) Cadenza, we both liked the car, it was room, the list of standard equipment was extensive and the price (base) was right in the middle of the V6 Honda Accord line.Talking with the salesman we asked about the K900, he laughed and told us that each Kia dealer was getting 1, and that is it. But of course some dealers didn't sell it and did a dealer trade to move it off the lot, the car was more of an exercise in, ""look what we can do, and showcase what Kia could be."" When it comes to Hyundai and the Genises and Equus I think you are going to see Hyundai move up scale with that brand. Both cars are bargains, they are reliable, and really a good bang for the buck, it has taken Hyundai years to be able to sell cars like those here, and yes, Virginia they really do sell Equus. I'm thinking the accents cars are going away, and left for Kia to sell."

Wellllll . . . the platform underpinning the Cayenne, Q7 and Touareg are shared. The new Macaan shares about 1/3 of its foundation, so to speak, with the SQ5, but each company puts it own completely different finishing touches on their versions.

I have a great deal of fondness for the VW Touareg, but few would think it was same SUV as the Cayenne.

The various brands do much to differentiate their offspring from the donor chassis. Audi and Porsche use different transmissions, engines, etc. VW, no matter how high up the chain it goes isn't the same SUV (as the others) any more than the Passat is, er, an A6, etc."

I distinctly remember having this discussion before. @flightnurse also has his 320i ""chipped."" It is definitely an issue that varies from dealer to dealer. If you've got a service department that is enthusiast friendly than you should be OK. If your dealership's service department is a ""by the book czar,"" then they will find the 6 degrees of separation between your leaking wiper fluid tank and your chip. Once they figure it out, they will void your warranty.

Unfortunately I think part of it is the litigious society we live in today. BMW is very specific about not wanting its customers to modify its vehicles in any way. This includes everything from chips to tires. BMW or its dealerships don't want to be liable.

Brad you are missing the point, BMW knows that people will chip their cars and have a safety net built in regarding added HP. I do not think the BMS stage 1 will cause the engine to be less reliable then a stock engine. I have 38K miles on my 320i and ever have had an engine issue or code thrown. OF course there are those with 320i's who are really pushing those engines making upwards of 300hp. I would assume that BMW, Audi and any manufacture with a turbo engine would assume a certain percentage of owners would ""chip"" their cars to get the extra HP from them. If they don't, then they aren't being realistic."

There are those like yourself who want a little extra oomph (I drive a 175 hp 4cyl Legacy daily so I know about needing and wanting extra oomph), and those that modify the car within an inch of its life. I really don't think BMW wants owners modifying their cars in any way. They don't even want owners checking their own oil with a dipstick for cryin' out loud.

Going with what @Mr_Shiftright said, did you price out a 328i similarly equipped to your 320i? Now that you have Rick's 328xi GT back stateside, have you driven the 2 cars back to back? Do you plan to keep your 320i for the long haul or will you start looking once the end of the 50K warranty is coming near?

I hope you don't think I'm trying to pick a fight with you. I'm honestly curious to your mindset. I'm completely neurotic when it comes to ""pushing the envelope"" with certain things. I KNOW I'd be the guy that gets caught & has to fight not to get my warranty voided.

Just as an example, this past Saturday night my wife & I took our 3 kids to an AHL (minor league) hockey game. We always get the kids something to eat when we go to an event, but we do like to bring our own juice, water, & snacks so we don't spend a car payment on concessions. My wife brings a bag in, holding our daughter & gets waved right through. My bag gets searched thoroughly & a few bottles of water as well as bags of chips get tossed before I walk in.

I made a mistake when I bought my 320i, I should have gotten a 328i. Listen learned... I almost pulled a trigger on a BMW Loaner, basically it was a fully loaded 328i, M Sport, Tech, DHP, Premium, Drivers Assistance package, heated seats. It only had 4K miles on it, MSRP was 52K, final sale price was $44K, but I would have had to roll about 9K into the deal, lease payments would have been about 576/m with zero out of pocket. decided not to do it. I'll tough it out until Oct 2017 when we a another ED. I like the M2, but I think it will be small, I'm hoping that BMW will build a M4 Grand Coupe for 2018, if not then a 440i Grand Coupe it shall be, with the MPPK, and MPE, which makes more HP then the BMW stage 1."

4281,markcincinnati,December 2015,"Used to Be a Pet Peeve, Now Just Confusing

I used to represent these remarks:

I participate some, but read at lot of postings on Audiworld. I read the posts of folks who seem to research and often agonize over the new Audi they have or are about to order.

Then, as time passes, their new prize possessions arrive and they take pictures of their soon to be delivered rides -- they post them and seem to beam with pride about the new car they have acquired.

Next, pictures of the new cars in the owner's driveways or garages are posted -- and the captions on these pics are ""Let the Mods Begin.""

Later, the details of the aftermarket wheels, tires, engine management chips, breathing management aids and even brake rotors are detailed along with the window tinting expenses and, sometimes, even elaborate retrofitting of navigation systems to cars not factory equipped with nav systems are laid out, including the sometimes breathtaking costs required to add such features aftermarket.

In some cases the modifications involve the suspension systems, exhaust systems and underhood plumbing (for the super or turbo chargers) too.

The expenses seem to have no ceiling -- and as soon as one is completed, the next improvement is lusted after in print on the Audiworld forum for that particular model.

Often, so it seems, these mods exceed the costs of simply ordering the cars with the factory upgrade. I mean, really, I have seen folks mod their A4 SLines so much that they reach and sometimes surpass the MSRPs of the car so lusted after, the S4.

The mods that make the A4 have more power often will void the warranty. The S4, stock, comes with a very nice warranty.

Why buy a nearly $50K A4 and mod the crap out of it so that you have more than the cost of an unmodded S4 in it, knowing that the S4 is likely to outperform the modded A4?

Is the joy of modding the joy? If a stock S4 can be had for about the same cost as a modded A4 (which then loses its warranty) what in the wide wide world of sports would posses someone to do this?

BTW, I said, it takes one to know one -- but I must admit, my modding was limited to a chip put into an Audi turbo engine for a total cost well under $1000. But I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.

Color me confused."

The Sport Package on the 320i is really a great package, give you all the suspension parts , seats, and steering wheel (M Sport) wheels and tires plus for the first time the 320i can be had with the M Sport Adjustable suspension, this is part of the track package.

My MS3 gets the same mileage as it did prior to installing the tune; there's no magic involved- the tune modifies the ignition advance, fueling, and boost primarily at higher rpm and throttle openings. At cruise the car is running on what is essentially the stock map, with perhaps a bit more spark advance dialed in.
For what it's worth, BMW also claims that their MPPK does not affect fuel economy.

But how about reliability, longevity? Can you say with certainty, it's unchanged? Noise, wear, low end vs. high end torque. I suppose it's possible that current factors of safety are so high that the lowering them does not bring appreciable differences. I just caution against ""it's all free"" attitude. In nature, nothing is free. You always pay somewhere.

Well said. There is no way of saying with certainty that an individual vehicle broke because of the mods. However, the statistics and principles of physics say that the probability of such failure increased, it could be by a little or a lot, depending on how big the mod was, how the car was driven, etc.

It's fine to mod the car, if that's what floats one's boat. The cost may be instantly evident, or deferred in time (perhaps beyond the ownership span), it may be high or low. The benefits may as well be worth it for the owner, outweighing that cost, I'm not disputing that, either. I simply disagree with the ""zero cost whatsoever"" notion.

I did some homework when I modified the supercharger on my car. I opted for colder spark plugs a larger intercooler and using the very best engine oils. So far so good. I will throw a check engine light though if I do a long hard climb up a mountain on a hot day. No doubt related to fuel mixture."

Because it is a limited warranty. It is a modest gain in power in those instances and they only need to cover it for 50k, 60k, or what have you. They may know, just for example, the unmodded engines can go 150k, while the modded ones go 120k. Either is certainly covered by warranty, but they'd rather have more of the 150k cars running around to uphold some face. If they made strictly vehicles that only lasted just past their warranty, it wouldn't bode well for their reputation.

Here...Here! So true.

I do remember when I put so much stock into 0-60 numbers from the car rags. That is, until I read an article (probably from C&D or R&D) that showed how they came up with those numbers. Usually, it was a get the revs up, drop the clutch, and try to keep it in a straight line, sort of ordeal. I don't drive like that (at least, not any more).

These days, I look at the entire package. Steering, handling, suspension's abilities to negotiate rough pavement without dancing...somewhere down the list is acceleration. Got to admit, even lux cars and mundane sedans are pretty darned quick these days.

For instance, the mechanic that works on my car. He gets OEM parts from the part manufacturer, not necesearily the auto manufacturer. Let's say Audi uses a certain sensor for the brakes. He'll get the sensor in the Bosch Box, not from Audi. His overhead is also much less than the gorgeous dealer with loaner cars, flat screen TVs, free WiFi, coffee...

Let's say the dealer wants to charge $1500 to do pads & rotors on all 4 corners, a solid independent shop might charge $800 or so.

Agree regarding finding a well qualified shop -- one that specializes in your brand, for these cars are breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair after the OEM warranty/""free"" service period expires.

ONE factor in favor of the dealer -- and it may or may not impress you -- they (ours anyway) will do it right the first time and if not, make it right for no extra charge. That has not been my experience with the folks who don't charge like a dealer.

Nevertheless, there are competent specialists in most cities, and my opinion is that they will save you money. My wife likes the loaner program, so she values the free loaner very much."

I've had two A6's have their brakes replaced and I have the wear pattern progression of both my wife's SQ5 and my S4. She has over 50K on hers and the dealer says she'll probably need new REAR brakes in less than 10K miles from now. Not sure what that means with respect to when the FRONT brakes would need replacing.

Audi suggests new rotors, on our BMW's the service dept said BMW prohibits a ""brake job"" from being carried out without also changing the rotors. On my 2005 A6, I had all four brakes (rotors included) replaced at around 48K miles at no charge under the Audi advantage. That option, via the Audi advantage, now is only free for the first 12K miles if I read the AA correctly.

BMW costs, thankfully covered, were a small four figure number for new brakes for a 2008 X3. Whew, avoided that one.

Audi prices, still breathtaking, seem to be lower, but it seems to me that the costs would be still at least 75% of the BMW costs (at the dealer).

On my 2001 A6, I bought cross drilled rotors (not from the dealer) and took them to the dealer for installation.

I love the brakes on our Audis -- and 50 to 60K for replacement doesn't seem horrible -- what does seem to be the case though is that the costs (using Audi parts) do seem too high. Yet, the brakes are one area that I am certainly not willing to go no-name brand installed at Midas, or where ever.

We'll probably get the new REARS on the SQ5 at the dealer and pay a couple hundred bucks more for peace of mind."

Same with my 06 Passat. Rear pads replaced around 50k, rotors left intact and didn't need resurfacing. Not sure this answer was correct but the service advisor told me there was more bias dialed to the rear brakes than in the past to take some of the stress off the front brakes. (?)

Yeah.. my dealer quoted around $600 just to do the rear brakes on my '06 model BMW. A lot of that is the OEM BMW rotors. Really, really pricy. I had my independent do the job with BMW pads and sensor, but with aftermarket rotors. Saved about half.

I've been told by techs that since front brakes do most of the work, the OEM brake pads on the rear are thinner. The goal is so that all four wheels reach replacement at the same time. The 2005 Passat I just traded had the rears done at 60K and all four were due to be done when I traded at 135K. I never did the fronts in that time.

My experiences don't match that - I usually don't find significant repair costs until around 120K, My Acura TL (2005) is at 155K right now and I had my first significant repair at around 130K, which was $1300 for some suspension work (control arms, etc.).

Fortunately, I'm able to drive without windshield washer fluid, and the tank must have a 1/3 or 1/4 reserve below the hose lines so it still worked, was just low soon after using it a few times (tripping a warning light).

Net net - you don't always get a certified car- BUT if you go to a honest bigger dealer (and go lux) you have a better chance of getting that peach.

I do business with a guy who had one replaced on a Jeep Compass twice.  Once on Chrysler's dime @ 60K, then again on his credit card @ 120K.  It is part of the reason I bought the 100K extended warranty for my Legacy.

Living with the CVT for 16 months and a little over 25K miles, I'm pretty impressed with it.  Those who don't know (the wife) think it is a traditional automatic transmission (plus I'd get the eye roll if I tried to explain otherwise).  It is very linear & smooth.  It doesn't drone as some reviews suggest (trust me, I'd know).  It also makes the most of my Legacy's meager 175 hp.

Yeah....nice thing about Acuras (and Hondas in general) are how they retain their value. I know the brand is going through a bit of an identity crisis, but as Bradd says, they are good value when discounted as new cars. Matter of fact, tough to find a better value at $35k-$42K.

That's one reason that even though I love driving German cars, I've just had enough of their service and parts prices. Over the years the amount of actual service needed in cars has gone way down - I remember the '70's where I had to replace plugs, oil, adjust valves, timing, replace points and condenser - every 6K miles!

4432,roadburner,February 2016,"Those of you who don't follow the Cars & Conversation or Chronic Car Buyers topics might be interested to know that I picked up a CPO 2014 M235i about two weeks ago. My wife insisted that I check it out; I originally intended to drive it first and then drive a couple of new Mustang GTs in the same general area. As it turned out I ended up making a deal then and there.

I was honestly surprised at how good it was. The car is about the same size as an E36, which suits me perfectly(a main sticking point on the Mustang was its size). It has just about every option save the the Helen Keller Package(Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure warning, etc.). It's also an automatic, but being the Sport derivation of the ZF HP8 I can live with it(in any event, I still have the Club Sport and Wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).

What do I like?
The transmission actually does what I want it to do in Sport+/Manual mode- every other BMW automatic I have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the B7 press loaner I tested a while back. Think: electronic full manual valve body, for any older drag racers out there. Durability should be decent as the M235i Racing gets essentially the same transmission, albeit with more aggressive software.

The Adaptive M Suspension literally transforms the car when you toggle into Sport or Sport+. It's almost like two different cars. I've never driven a BMW where the EDC or AMS made such a huge difference.

The standard M Performance Power Kit really eliminates the turbo lag; with 330 lb-ft of torque available from 1300 rpm it almost feels like some of the big block Chevys I drove in my misspent street racing youth. Fuel economy is hovering around 25 mpg, which is more than good enough for me.

Michelin PSS in a staggered setup are standard. No run flats!

The sports seats with adjustable bolsters are excellent as expected. It's no wonder that BMW NA is making them standard fitment in many US models; the base seats in newer BMW are only good for generating business for chiropractors.

The H-K audio is good enough that I don't feel like I have to tweak it right away.

Dislikes?
The steering could use a bit more feel. That said, the effort and ratio(s)-Variable Sport Steering is standard-is very good.

I agree with Bob Harper fromBMW CAR : the IP needs oil and water temperature gauges instead of the ""///M 235i"" graphic that illuminates as soon as you open the driver's door

The brakes are great but the pedal feel is somewhat wooden.

No LSD. I will definitely have to add one sooner than later; at half throttle it will light up the rear tires in Comfort mode with DSC fully enabled.

Track time will have to wait a few months. The 2ers first outing will be at Putnam Park- which is my ""home"" track. I'm too old to attempt to learn a car and a track at the same time. It will also see at least one night at the local 1/8th mile strip- might as well test the Launch Control...

A couple of people asked me to compare it to the E30 M3; the 2er is not as light on its feet and it lacks the ""hard-wired to the synapses"" experience of the original M3. However, it is very comparable to the E46 M3 in terms of handling and braking. Power in contrast, is more akin to that of the E9x M3 at least from a usability standpoint on public roads. In any event, I can easily see keeping this car for a decade or more. Who knows when/if Munich will build anything RWD in this size class again?

So... Is it worthy of an ///M badge? I'd say it's closer to an ""is,"" but that said, most everyone has forgotten that the first M car based on a production model was the E12 M535i- which boasted the M30 3.5 motor from the E24 635i along with an upgraded suspension, an M body kit, and aggressively bolstered front seats. Sound familiar?

You can order a M3/M4 that comes in under the 65K mark, the only option I would get on them is M Adapative Suspension, for 1K that is it. But the GT350 fully loaded in far less then that. When it comes to the ADM well just wait, that will go away too."

Those of you who don't follow the Cars & Conversation or Chronic Car Buyers topics might be interested to know that I picked up a CPO 2014 M235i about two weeks ago. My wife insisted that I check it out; I originally intended to drive it first and then drive a couple of new Mustang GTs in the same general area. As it turned out I ended up making a deal then and there.

I was honestly surprised at how good it was. The car is about the same size as an E36, which suits me perfectly(a main sticking point on the Mustang was its size). It has just about every option save the the Helen Keller Package(Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure warning, etc.). It's also an automatic, but being the Sport derivation of the ZF HP8 I can live with it(in any event, I still have the Club Sport and Wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).

What do I like?
The transmission actually does what I want it to do in Sport+/Manual mode- every other BMW automatic I have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the B7 press loaner I tested a while back.

Okay, need a legend here. What does EDC and AMS stand for?

Have you had enough seat time in other recent model sporty cars to judge other ""adaptive"" suspensions with the M235i? I didn't notice hardly any change in a Lexus IS350 for example, and it had 4 different settings! The S3 only has 2 truly different settings; definitely noticeable. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a different car, but even in a short test drive, it was a good difference. If these adaptive suspensions don't add significant weight; I'd say they are definitely worth it as a Win Win.

Sorry! EDC= Electronic Damper Control AMS= Adaptive M Suspension
Very similar similar systems that use various sensors and switch settings to modify jounce and rebound settings on the shocks. The GM's magnetorheological suspensions are more sophisticated and versatile, but I haven't had much experience with them. I haven't driven that many cars with adjustable damping aside from BMWs, and the M235i system makes the most noticeable difference that I've experienced.

I hate dealing with most body shops; if the car looks good from 20 feet away the average customer is ecstatic- and as a result, the work really suffers.

Yes, they were certified, and there's only 3 in all of San Diego County! However, they were so horrible, I imagine a typical decent body shop would probably out-perform them, though I haven't had luck with any body shops in San Diego County yet (tried 4 different ones now).

I did tell Audi that they need to immediately de-certify them. They used to have a good reputation locally in Escondido (by San Diego), but they got bought out by Caliber Collision (the McDonald's of Body Shops) years ago. They kept the old name along with Caliber Collision to fool people, and they still are certified by Audi to this day despite my complaints.

I agree with you, they get away with shoddy workmanship because most people won't take their car back 3 times until they get it right like I did.

4451,sweendogy,March 2016,@andres3 I really feel for the story- last month my neighbor backed into the front quarter of my car. Damage just to the one panel (I hope)- I have been waiting on getting the car fixed- may wait another 6 months or so as my hope is to have it fixed correctly and then quickly trade in for the next model s4 which I'm guessing will be available at that time. The tale of issues you have had with your car would have driven me to roll it off a cliff.

Automatic owners should note on page 5 that ZF recommends an ATF change every 60,000-120,000 km(50,000-75,000 miles) or 8 years under the following conditions:

- frequent highway driving in top speed range,
- offensive, sporty driving style,
- frequent trailer operation,

I plan to change the ATF in the 2er every 50,000 miles, primarily because it will be my track toy for the next several years. Otherwise I would go with the 75,000 mile interval. I tend to be proactive with respect to vehicle maintenance and I believe it pays off; I've had the ATF changed in the GM A5S 390R(5L40E) in my '04 X3 2.5i every 60k miles.

It's OK .. over $5K due at signing, but you'll get the $3850 back at the end. Oh, plus DMV and dealer fee costs, whatever those happen to be.

NJ calculates sales tax on the sum of the payments and the customer can either pay it up front or add it into the cap cost, which will increase the payment.

You could probably negotiate a better price than that used in the ad to lower your payment.

Yeah but the dealer can jack up the MF, and if they do that to the max as Michael points out, that's one whole 1% more interest; and those 7 payments are held hostage against any damage (read the fine print) --not a great position for negotiation at turn-in.

that was something I wondered about with the MSDs. On my lease, there is no security deposit, so if they want to ding me for damage, they have to ask for it and I can argue. But if they have $3,500 ""on account"", they can keep whatever they want, and I would have to fight them to get it back.
I agree with the thought process on this... It's the same reason I don't use a debit card. But, in reality, all cars get an inspection at your home/business, and a printout is given to you then (3-4 weeks before turn-in). You owe what you owe, regardless of deposit.

I've done it twice, and no issues.

I was going to post something like this, I would suspect that it all depends on how much reconditioning your car needs, if you take care of your car and it's just normal wear and tear, then it's not an issue, but if you don't care how many stains there are inside or scraps and dents and road rash on the rims, then I get could see BMW holding back some money."

Can't argue with you that it seems Audi finally took some cost cut measures when making the current generation A3's interior. I love the round air vents though, that's our only disagreement. The driving feel; did you toss it around?, feels like a very light and lively chassis to me. The 1.8T I'm not a fan of; the 2.0T should be standard, better power, and better fuel economy at the same time. Before someone argues, note the 2.0T adds quattro without losing MPG, that's better efficiency by a large margin. The 2.0T is a stellar engine.

Do you know if your wife's A3 is still made in Germany (VIN start with W), and the Golf probably made in Mexico (VIN number starts with 3 I think). After solving the Mexican teething quality control issues, I""m sure your Golf will serve you as well as any Honda for reliability and durability.

4500,dino001,May 2016,"Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels. It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network. They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market.

I read that Detroit's problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts. They essentially make a car and then try to sell it. Others often have mindset that they won't make a car until they have some evidence it's actually needed somewhere. It can be a real order (customer's or dealer's - BMW operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (Japanese reportedly do it that way). In other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it. Detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it. Any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers.

For comparison, Tampa Bay (not including Sarasota) has 3 BMW, MB, 2 Audi and 2 Acura, 1 Jaguar store, and only 4 Cadillac stores, which doesn't sound bad. But extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes dramatically: it adds about one dealer for Sarasota for all Germans, one store in Lakeland for BMW and MB, but Cadillac's network grows to 13 stores. Considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts. May be convenient, but there is no pricing power. I'm sure those dealers are hurting, too. This of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn't have any money will not support their customer.

Cadillac's management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it. They want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain't gonna happen. You can pick two. They probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned.

It may be true, but the reality is people don't buy them in numbers produced and those who buy expect pricing below what Cadillac thinks they should pay. So either the cars stay on lots, or they move at prices below expected levels. Something's got to give. Mere wishing is not going to solve it - yet, so far that's all we see from them - trying to charm reality with corporate chants, not real moves.

I built a Luxury model online with AWD, Upgraded Wheels (the black ones).  The sticker price shoots close to $50K very quickly (as it does on many entry level luxury performance sedans).  If GM is constantly throwing $10K rebates at these cars at the end of the year, why not lower the cost of entry to begin with?

Simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more. Moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount. Not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer. Last - they still think ""It's a Cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago.

CG what has happened with your CTS? Had Caddy made good on fixing it?

Now I like the CTS, but I really think Caddy needs to stop with these half size cars. The ATS is a 3 series fighter, but it's smaller on the inside. The CTS is a 5 series fighter however, it's is smaller inside, and slight larger then a 3 series. I would assume if they want to compete with the 3 and 5 series they need to be competitive on all fronts. For my next car I'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the A6 and E class, but the CTS isn't on my list until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars."

'16 has been perfect. These new Caddys are really nice cars. They're built well. They use very nice materials in them, they look great, and they perform and handle great. But, that's not what people want from Caddy. They want the Caddy that's in the Escalade.

Not sure I'll buy another, but so far, I'm loving the '16 version.

But, as others point out, it's not enough to build a really good car. Perception is what makes people pony up. Funny, people are willing to buy the most expensive Cadillac, but it's the poorest performer. Again, perception.....

The best Cadillacs are the ATS and the CTS, but people are avoiding them. I know resale is terrible, but I bought my CTS for what a cheaper 3 series or C300 would cost. But, it's as good, and in many respects better, than the E Class or 5 Series.

Cadillac seems to be driving itself into a ditch. Cadillac was #1 in luxury sales from about 1920 until the late 1990s—only 20 years ago.

As most of you are tired of hearing me saying , Cadillac remain relatively stagnant until everyone who bought one in the 1980s is dead. We have about another ten years, if Cadillac can chug along until then.

Another problem, aside from the dubious reputation of the past tarnishing their quite good products of the present, is, as you have all mentioned, unrealistic pricing. This seems to keep their sales figures firmly rooted to the same numbers, year after year.

And say, where's Jaguar? I'm actually quite worried about that company. Let's hope jumping into the SUV market will save them---if that flops, I think you can kiss them goodbye. They are only at 25% of their 2002 U,S, sales figures.

Cadillac, on the other hand, has been pretty consistent, hovering in the 200,000 range per year since 2002. They seem to be on a 175,000 pace for 2016. So, same-o, same-o for Cadillac.

They do, but shortening the coverage will make them even more dependent on leases. I'm sure a good extension and certified preowned programs coukd bridge the gap.

As much as those that really look at the math (like you and me) value the maintenance program, BMW decided that the marketing value of the plan didn't justify their increased costs. They are probably correct. Unfortunately.

If I didn't know a great Indy Audi Shop then I might feel differently about the value of free maintenance. Also, if the car is totaled early in its life, I don't believe you get a penny for ""free maintenance"" back. So it could end up being worthless.

I think BMW found that a few too many non-badge buyers are driving the heck out of these cars, and M brakes are very expensive to service and replace (pads and rotors).

Trying to remember what the maintenance items might be in that 4th year, but BMW saved themselves a ton of money. Probably cut out one brake replacement, an oil change, probably some AWD services, wipers, perhaps some other minor things. But, that 4th year would probably be the most expensive to cover than the previous 3 years combined.

And, given that a majority of BMWs are leased for 36 months, I don't think they are offending that segment of their customers by dropping the 4th year.

That's why I'm so disappointed. 3/36 maintenance plans have generally low value, as they cover basic oil change and sometimes air filter. 4/50 plan run into a need of first major service, even on computer based. My brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (I'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently. There may also be some more fluids to be changed, if your computer senses more severe driving condition.

Wipers are generally cheap, so not much value there, especially that there are some decent aftermarket wipers for $20 or so, but it seems like just pettiness from their part to cut that one. Whatever. I guess dealers can now charge those uninformed good money for their ""genuine"" wiper and even add ""installation fee"" for good 30 minutes of hard work of super-certified technician. BTW, this is not first time I see pettiness in their conduct. My navigation (it's older-generation, still hard disk based system) doesn't have a single automotive store (like AutoZone, etc.), or other brand dealerships in it. Just ridiculous, if you think about it.

I'll live, but I'm quite disappointed overall. Just confirms to me - there is no reason for any kind of loyalty. It's all ""what you have done for me lately"". It's OK, I'll do the same.

I haven't checked the equipment level on the Honda recently - it certainly may have changed with the recent facelift - but at one point the Acura had a better suite of safety and tech features, such as a true blind spot monitoring system. On the Honda, it seemed you had to get the ""Touring"" model to get that, which got quite expensive. And, for what it's worth, the TLX may be conservative in its own right, but I think it's still more distinctive than an Accord.

Having said that, the Accord is a great car - but I'd take a used TLX over a new Accord. Best value? perhaps a used Accord.

Actually, car-wise, there have been good signs for Jag since the '04 XJ's all aluminum architecture (and Ford cash flow). Unfortunately, nobody noticed as it continued the XJ style of the '60s. Handsome, but been there, done that. The current lineup are all winners as vehicles that offer performance, style and quality. From my personal (and, of course a sample set of 1) experience build, reliability and materials are all excellent.

The XE and F-Pace early reviews are almost all big thumbs up. I'm torn, want Jag to survive and thrive, yet selfishly I hate to potentially lose the relative exclusivity of driving a Jag.

My 17 y.o. son believes I'm being selfish, that there's no reason for someone of my advanced years to be driving an XF, when it would so much better serve his purposes. The '02 RX300 he currently is lucky enough to drive would be much better suited to me. Gotta like the attitude, if not the logic!

Other times, it starts to get on your nerves. You start thinking about it, anticipating it, flinching when it happens.

It's really bad when that happens AFTER you have bought the car, and have to live with it. One of the reasons I like, whenever possible, to rent a very similar vehicle for an ""extended test drive"". Live with the car for a week or so, try it out in everyday life.

Now I did have the Hyundai dealer offer me an overnight with a used Genesis that I was thinking about quite hard. I didn’t take him up on the offer, as I was afraid that I would buy it!

Looks like Audi is on the right track.  Make a great car.  Slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.

I hate to be ""that guy,"" but in a couple of years, a CPO S3 or S4 might make a good buy.  I keep seeing more and more Audis on the road.  They definitely ""look the part"" and distinguish themselves from the sea of 3 series and C-Class' out on the road.  

I saw a run of the mill A3 2.0T sedan in grey with what looked like some nice, thick, 5 Spoke silver & black wheels, a lip spoiler that I liked.  

There te seems to be a good amount of these current or 1 year old CPO A3 & A4 units for sale at a healthy discount off sticker.

4605,flightnurse,June 2016,"So the test drive went well, just a little FYI, it was 110 today here in Sunny PHX...

So I test drove two A4's, but 2017, I drove a Premium Plus FWD with a CVT (only transmission that comes with FWD) and a Premium Plus Auto ( Quattro)

I have always liked the looks of the Audi's and their interiors have always been very clean (almost like someone from Denmark designed them) and minimalist at the same time. The size of the A4 is bigger then last Gen, so in comparison it's slight bigger then my 320, but the 3GT has more rear legroom.

I was surprised how well the CVT shifts, but there is still that rubber band feeling, the Auto in the Quattro was better, but not too sure if AWD is really needed here in the Desert. The 252 HP 2L has a lot of motivation, but our 3GT is quicker (it has the BMS stage 1) over all driving the car is drove well, both with CVT or Duel Clutch but I give the Dual Clutch the nod, pricing for the cars are very competitive, you can get a Premium Plus for about 46K fully loaded, very competitive with BMW and a 328i. Even in Quattro you can tell the car is based on FWD. Fit and Finish was first rate, and would give Audi a nod for the feel of the leather over both of our BWW's.

The size of the A4 felt just right not too bed or too small, I'm not too sure if an A6 is needed, plenty of rear leg room and head room, even behind the drivers seat once I adjusted the drivers seat to my liking. I sat in a 2017 S3 and found small and I can see the appeal to it."

I agree, based on that review it looks like Audi TTS-ified the S3. No wonder I liked, but didn't love the '16 and older S3's. That being said the performance enthusiasts will be taking advantage of the new engine's stage 1 tunes coming in at about 350+ HP. No need for the 5-cylinder unless you just have to have the superior ""sound"" of it.

For example, my 318ti(with a Turner Motorsports Conforti chip) makes around 140 lb-ft of torque at 4500 rpm. You simply must keep the engine wound tight to make anything close to rapid progress- and it's a lot of fun to drive it in that fashion. In contrast, my M235i makes 330 lb-ft of twist from 1300 to 4500 rpm; with such a flat torque curve there is almost always a ton of thrust available regardless of rpm and/or the gear selected. It's also nice to have a car that can convert from cruise mode to track toy mode with the press of a button. If I was buying an M2 or M3 I would definitely go with a manual every time, but in the less intense models an automatic transmission does not detract from my enjoyment of the car- but then at 59 I'm fast approaching geezer status.

They had 650i GC, 550i sedan, 4289GC, X1,X3, X5 40e (plug in) they also has a 340i sedan that was a rolling catalog for the M Sport performance parts. I drove only 4 of them, the 650, 550, X5 and X1. First time driving the 650iGC and I loved it, It handled well, was roomy and it didn't look like a typical sedan, it was fully load, M Sport, Executive package, B&O radio and a couple of other options (don't remember what they were) but the TT V8 is a monster, and I would get tickets in it, the 550 was equipped pretty much the same way and I wasn't that happy with it felt bigger and disconnected but then again the TTV8! The X5 40e was a complete surprise it was comfortable to drive, you have a very commanding view of the road, the power train was great never did I feel being between pure elec and gas engine, the 2L gas engine was peppy enough to move the big X5 without much problem, very refined.. The X1 was a big disappointment but after thinking about it for a couple of day, there was no way the X1 was going to impress me or Rick after driving the other 3 cars, the X1 feels like a much lower price car, lots of road noise and tire noise, the ride was bouncey and never felt planted. plus it was much smaller then I thought it was going to be.

Rick drove the 428GC that was loaded with M Sport and couple of other packages and really liked how it drove, but he did like the 650GC too.

Spoke to a CA and we took out a 640iGC and really liked how that one drove, yeah it's down on power, but the planted feel and comfortable but firm ride was still there.

Yes the N63 (engine code) has had problems and it appears BMW has a fix, the truly sad part really is, Audi and MB both have TT V8 and don't have problems with theirs. I had thought about a 550 in the past but after researching the N63 issues and the factory fix, I'm not totally convinced they have it fixed. Here are a could of threads on Bimmerfest regarding the N63 engine problems.

I think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the TLX. Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland.

The base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the Accord. But most competitors have turbo base models that are faster.

The 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the TLX with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the V-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.

Acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. And the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car.

Finally, the Accord now has AndroidAuto/AppleCarPlay, but the TLX isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced TLX that's coming next year as a 2018 model.

Agreed. Plus, the Accord has now started knipping at the heals of the TLX. Acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss. ILX, TLX, RLX (especially the RLX) have missed their respective marks, badly.

I still like the TLX (and all of my previous TLs). But, given the transmission woes, and that just about every other lux manufacturer out there offers AWD and some sort of torque vectoring system, which was at one time unique to the TL (and some Audis), isn't so unique any more.

I know holding the prices on the TLX trasnlates into higher resale value, but it's hurting their sales on the new end.

Let's face it, Acura is becoming more an SUV company than a car company.

Not really. Since it's a deposit, you get the money back. Since it lowers the MF, it can be seen as earning interest on the money. So if you take 7xSD, lowering MF on the entire lease amount, you essentially leveraged say 3 grand to reduce interest on say 30-40 grand (average capital cost between purchase and disposition). Translate that money back and you won't get anywhere near interest in a bank, if you keep the money. MSD is nothing like putting money down (cap cost reduction). Not even close. Don't put money down on lease, but MSD - good deal, IMHO.

Well, the '04+ TL was many great things:

1) A Power leader at 270 HP V6 3.2 Standard - In later years that became a 3.5 and 3.7 with good numbers.
2) Was a very good looking sedan with a nice interior.
3) Class-leading super modern audio DVD-audio playing music system (that's special and rare).
4) Handled really well.

The TLX currently in my opinion is:

1) Pretty bland; no visible exhaust either
2) A bottom feeder for power with either engine (as compared to the competition). They don't even offer a 3.7 anymore!
3) If the Audio systems still plays DVD-A discs I'd be surprised pleasantly, I don't know? I know the '14 TL did still play DVD Audio discs.
4) Handling is adequate but not particularly great.

That's correct on a BMW, just take one zero out of each number. .00007 and .00049
Also correct on having someone assume your lease. They have to reimburse you for the MSDs.

Well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but I truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. This is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car. But that's probably just my weird math sense.

Also, it's just plain good savings. Not artificially on payment, like cap cost reduction, but real savings on total amount of money paid out of your pocket. If you do math correctly, that 0.00049 MF on 50K car with 25K residual (not so great one) saves you 0.00049*(50K+25K) times 36 (typical 36 month lease with not-so-hot residual) is 1300, give or take, more if the residual is higher. Who would pay you 1300-1500 bucks on 4 grand over three years???

It's probably one of the best guaranteed rate of return in zero-interest environment (adjusted for risk, of course). It of course is not a real rate of return, just savings in interest charges (or their equivalents in lease).

If you lease, MSD is the way to go, period. There are no excuses. The lower payment is just a side benefit.

Exactly. The problem is, not all manufacturers offer MSD for leases. A quick summary - and I'll let @kyfdx chime in if my information is incorrect.

BMW - 7 MSDs at .00007 each - total MF reduction of .00049
Audi - 10 MSDs at .00005 each - total MF reduction of .00050
Lexus - 9 MSDs at .00008 each - total MF reduction of .00072
MB - no hard evidence on this; have had folks report that MSDs are only allowed on unsupported MF (standard MF is .00200 - .00220), but others have said otherwise

No MSD program for Infiniti or Acura. No information on Jaguar.

According to Edmunds.com, the average monthly payment on a new vehicle is $479. IF one wanted to make money on about 4K, one would use MSD's and save $50/m which is about 1900 on a three year lease. I can tell you one could get a nice 528i for $480/m with the currently RV that BMWFS is giving..."

Dino it is being judgmental, but many people would agree with you, on BF some 23 yr old out of college wanting to lease a new 340i, his payments are $600/m cough.... Should he have gotten that car, no, but no one was going to stop him, and BMWFS sure wasn't..

The average saving is roughly $1900 on a course of a lease, however, to really save that money one needs to take that $50 you save a month and place it into a saving account so at the end of that 3 yr lease you have that money.
Right is right, that's why I wrote ""too judgmental"". Anyway, one can do whatever they want, but I can also voice my opinion about the action. I just don't want to hear their complaints about Bush, Obama, bankers, Wall Street, or global warming next time their life and income prospects turn less then anticipated.

BTW, last thing a 23 yo needs is 340i, but surely if they want to spend their ćurrent and future last dime, nobody other than their family or loving friends, should stop them. Surely not BMWFS, as long ad they meet the criteria. That much I agree.

4685,dino001,August 2016,"I have always maintained Cadillac's dealer network is waaaay too big and does not fit a premium image they want to project. In small and midsize towns, local Chevy or Buick dealer also got a Caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when German competition was small and super-exquisite (Benz only sold what today would have been loaded E-class or up, at price point equivalent to today's S-Class) and Japanese brands were literally non-existent.

In today's world with all-out competition in premium at all levels, it simply doesn't cut it - the accessibility is a good thing, but in today's reality it collides too much with exclusivity they wish to project. They'd do better if they pulled sales franchises from those weak dealers, but supplied them with authorized service licenses.

Essentially, you buy your Caddy in a big showroom, comparable to those of MB, BMW, or Lexus, in a nearby big city, but can service it at a local Buick dealer garage, provided it passes the necessary requirements. That model might actually work. In Europe they generally have denser authorized service network than sales. American model somehow is such that if you want to service a brand, you have to sell it, too. No real reason for that, other than ""tradition"".

MSD's mean Multi Security Deposits, we are taught that when leasing one should never put any money down. However, with MSD, you are basically buying down the money factor (APR) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment. At the end of your lease you will get your MSD's back or if you want and lease another BMW you can roll the MSD's into your new lease. The added saving for a typical 3 yr lease is about $1900."

The leasing company gets the use of the MSD funds for the duration of the lease. Add it up and you can make a decent amount of money if you invest it right.

Like in every transaction, both sides get a benefit, or they at least think they do, since it's voluntary. Here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment). In some way, it's similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent.

The lessor's benefit is cash today, which they can dispose as they see fit. Being a financial intitution, they are allowed to leverage that money to raise even more funds. Another benefit is more general, i.e. possible increase in product sales. Notice it's offered only by financial arms of some manufacturers.

This page gives a pretty good overview.
I just returned from the mandatory one week instructor led training; there's a strong emphasis on product knowledge as well as how to relate to the clients that we work with. I don't fit the typical genius profile due to the fact that I'm retired from my ""real"" job and thus I'm considerably older; In my class of twenty the next oldest person was about ten years younger than me and the rest were in their early to mid twenties. In addition; I have no interest in a promotion to client advisor or service advisor- although I did ""sell"" a CPO i3 yesterday in that I conducted the presentation and evaluation drive so that the client advisor was able to close the deal in just a few minutes.

Here is a deal someone posted on Bimmerfest.

How's this deal?
2016 340i - Black sapphire exterior with the coral red interior. M Sport package, tech package, cold weather package, Driver assistance package.
MSRP: $59515
Selling Price: $54230. Thats about 9% off MSRP. Sales rep said it was $1k below invoice
MF 0.00088 with 3.5K in MSDs
1.5k in taxes, $925 acq fee, misc dmv fees, luxury tax, and first payment = another 3.5k

term 10k/36: 0.66 Residual

Monthly: $497

So basically his payment is $497 so you round up to the nearest 50, so that would be $500x7 = 3500. This loweres your MF down.

Hope this helps."

As you might expect, his client base is heavily populated with attorneys.

A jump in deliveries of SUVs and crossovers helped Mercedes increase sales almost twice as fast as BMW in the first nine months, expanding the Daimler AG unit's lead to 57,985 cars, according to data released by the manufacturers.

Mercedes is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating BMW AG's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said this week, which would put Mercedes back on top for the first time since 2005.

Mercedes is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the GLC coupe and compact GLA sport utility vehicle.

BMW is responding with a revamp of its 5-Series business sedan to rival Mercedes's popular E-Class, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep distance to nearby cars.

The 5-Series, set to hit showrooms in February, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, BMW said in a statement on Thursday.

The car is critical for BMW after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-Series sedan received a muted response.

BMW has downplayed the impending loss of the No. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.

""Profitability remains our primary focus,"" BMW's head of sales Ian Robertson said in a statement on Thursday.

New entrants

Luxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving innovations while also having to spend more on developing electric cars to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.

BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen AG's Audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric cars, which will add to their research-and-development costs. After hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, Daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, CEO Zetsche said this week.

BMW's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in September, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.

By comparison, Mercedes's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in September, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement. Audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million cars, a 4.5 percent gain.

BMW 7 series is once again a contender and not a pretender. The 2017 BMW 5 series is said to be the Jr. version of the new 7. It will have most of the 7's new tech including Remote parking , Gesture control, Apple CarPlay, 4G LTE with WiFi, upgraded motor and shed close to 130 pounds

.The 530i will Start at 60k .

The 540i , 3.0............. 335 h/p 8 spd Trans should be a fun ride. Cant wait to go test drive it. I'd love to get another 2017..... 7er.................. but not willing to drop 100k at this point in my life.

I test drove the new G80 Genesis . Excellent all around vehicle without the fun factor of driving a S6, or BMW 550. The problem with this new G80 is.... looks to much like a Sonata from the back for 55k.

If you could get over the looks of this G80 / G90 vehicle it will pamper you with its amenity's. The 429 h/p , 9spd Trans is superb. The 3 mode upgraded suspension proves to be what this model was needing a few years back.............................. What a bang for your buck

Go test drive this model if you have the chance ...................... Hell of a job by Hyundai.

Curious if you know if the Genesis/Cadenza's are made in the USA like the Optima. Usually manufacturer's make their flagship where quality matters more than lowest bidder.

I like Harmon other wise known as HK. Don't think they should drop the Kardon part. My previous receiver which I still have is an HK. I'm keeping it because they don't make receivers like the two I own anymore. When the Denon konks out I'll switch back to the HK. Heck, I might switch out yearly just for the fun of it.

Biggest advantage the newer Denon has is the ability to read FLAC files. Other then that, the HK is perfect and probably superior despite the fact it's made in China .

I highly doubt the 530i will start at 60K, that is almost 10K more than the 2016 528i, and over 5K more then a 2017 E350. Since pricing hasn't been released I'm thinking base price for a 530i will be close to 53-55K. The standard equipment list for the 530i is impressive.

Genesis is a great bang for your buck and will pamper you with many amenities in the 42 to 52k price range. What I liked about the new model is the warranty, Largest car in its class. , ultra quiet ride, radio, 3 mode suspension, command center and large screen, everything inside is laid out nice and easy to use. The new redesign / wheels look terrible.

Its a perfect vehicle for folks who want a steady ride and could care less about brand or how uninspiring this vehicle seems when driven like the Audi , Bmw, or MB. Genesis 429 h/p and 9 spd trans works well in this vehicle. I call this new Genesis ( G80 ) the upper class large family sedan bargain .

The Camry XSE V-6 will take some sales away from the Honda Accord. I had a 13 Accord V-6 for 1yr. Very nice vehicle.

Next time I'm at the Mb dealership going to test drive the a 17 550i then hopefully at Audi there's a S6 to compare.

The 550i is nice enough, I just find the F10 too soft for my tastes. I think I'd rather have an M Sport X5 xDrive50i. I still think that the 340i is the sweet spot- for BMW sedans at any rate.
We don't expect to see any G30 5ers at our center until late January at the earliest- and those will all be in either 530i or 540i trim. The M550i xDrive will be offered a bit later- it sounds intriguing.

I was under the impression that all Dealers were getting 2 G30's as demo now, I like the concept of the 550i but that engine just has too many issue for me to spend 80K and have it break down like they have.

What I like about the G30 is now the 530i will get the M sport Suspension in the M Sport Package as standard equipment, that was a big mistake with the F10."

We looked at Volvo the XC60, at the time the tickets were only coach, I'm not sold on the supercharge and turbo charged engine. I like the S90 but they need more then a 4 cyl."
4790,dino001,October 2016,"XC60 is still only one line. That's the thing - most dealers didn't even stock R-line trims, so one wouldn't know about their existence without more extensive research. The salesman told me it's getting a little better after acquisition of Polestar, but will surely take time to get any following. Plus, those are much more risky models to stock, more expensive low volumes.

Regarding engines, everybody does strange stuff with engines today. Tripple scrollers, super/turbo charger mixes, batteries. It's just fact of life, especially on European brands.

I've heard of and looked at them briefly. I believe I looked closely at a S60R that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the S4. Unfortunately, I think it is more like an A4 competitor. It just doesn't win on any specification. And then I believe I saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rubber tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago). Base S4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255. My wife's Sportwagen has 225. That's not a deal breaker as I like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle.

Now, I hope some auto exec doesn't read this and start a tire size war.

Driven the TLX a couple of times (V6). If those incentives were going on when I was looking, my choice might have been different (ended up with a Q50 3.0T, which I like quite a bit).

While only test drives, I never experienced the untoward behavior of the 9-speed transmission in the V6 TLX that others reported. That said, the ones I drove were all in the last 18 mos, and perhaps Acura addressed those issues.

Be interested in the '18 TLX to see if they tweaked more than just the styling.

Agreed. That said, dealers are going to try to hold to MSRP on the '18s for as long as they can. I might look at them this time next year. But, for right now, a $45K '17 TLX SH-AWD ADVANCE would probably be in the realm of $35-$36K. The 4 cyl would probably be close, or maybe even below $30K. Both would be a screaming deal on a fun, reliable car.

You'll be fine. The B8.5 S4 is one of the finest cars ever made. Find a good indy shop for the services. My TTS was quoted $450 (w/ DSG) for the 35K service. I imagine the S4 would be within 10% of that at most.

The big discounts is really because every car magazine panned and they aren't selling. The V6 does not feel like it has 290hp, in Sport+ the transmission does not shift and crisp and sharp as the 4 cyl. Now I will give the seats major props here very comfortable. The car drove with typical Japanese blandness very isolated feeling. Now, there is nothing wrong with that if that is your thing. The dealer I went really wanted me to take a 6cyl w/Tech but didn't see the real value in it.

Infinity, while the Q40/50/60S are all heavy cars, they do have a 400 HP Red-Line and 3.0 L turbocharged power-trains. They seem to be making an effort.

I agree Acura seems to be lost; they gave up on their 3.7 engine, which is strange for Honda/Acura to give up on an engine so quickly.

Infinity, while the Q40/50/60S are all heavy cars, they do have a 400 HP Red-Line and 3.0 L turbocharged power-trains. They seem to be making an effort.

I'm thinking Acura will be dropping a turbo 4 into the TLX within the next 2 yrs. Honda will have a Turbo 4 in the Accord next year.

Basically told the dealer when they were serious about selling the car to call me.
Volvo S60, nice car, but the MF and RV is horrible, so I moved on.
Acura the dealer wanted to move a car, but wasn't all that thrilled on how it drive, either the 4-6 cyl
Lexus IS, drove well, even though the dealer wanted to move a unit, the RV and MF were high as well as lease payments.

It isn't manual, but it will do.

I thought I wanted 435, then 440 GC all that time until I spent some good time with the 430/330, got to play with the sport/sport+ modes and became convinced to keep the money, both in the purchase and at the pump. For me it's good enough. I think I'm already past the ""got to have the horses"" stage. There is minimum I want/need, of course, probably higher than the market average, but 430 is quite enough.

Best of all, there’s a lot more driving fun than you’d expect in an entry-level scooter, especially considering its front struts, rear torsion beam setup. Its progressive and predictable in its behavior, so much so, you might wonder when the hot hatch variant will arrive, something you would never say of a Kia Rio in past form.
It lacks the expected Korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. Take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the Rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. Credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.

When it comes to tech, Kia has you covered with Bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Standard safety features include six airbags, side-impact door beams, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, hill-start assist and vehicle stability management.

Probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. If the 3er has the M Sport or the Adaptive M Suspension all bets are off. Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic.

Also prices have continued to skyrocket in ELLPS. I know what I bought my Audi A4 for in 1998, and I'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. So ELLPS is more or less out of what I want to pay.

However there are some decently compelling ""mundane"" cars that can be loaded up to levels that approach (and sometimes exceed) ELLPS. If you want the badge then you go ELLPS. If you want much of the actual benefit and to save some cash, then dropping down a market notch is not a bad idea."

That's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving... Funny, seats, while comfortable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste. Gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries. Maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats? I have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on New Year's Eve, variety is not your spice of life!

The rotating vents are a cool feature....the first couple of times you see 'em. You can easily program them to stay open, which I will do as soon as the warranty expires!

Interesting - forgot about the A3 in your family. A longer term comparison will be interesting. Gotta have your son drive the Hyundai and offer his opinion. Better yet, let him take it to NY and drive it for a month (when the weather is nicer).

But is it really comparable?

220 HP vs. 201 hp for the Hyundai
Torque disparity is larger I believe if I'm not mistaken.
24/33 MPG vs. 26/33 for the Hyundai; now that's close, but the Audi engine is 20% bigger.

I think the point is you can get 80% (or more) of the performance and features for 50% of the price.

Same or similar drivetrains, all loaded up, and more than just a nod to similar styling, ELLSS become harder to differentiate from their parent company.

Probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. If the 3er has the M Sport or the Adaptive M Suspension all bets are off. Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic.

I don't like FWD in anything larger than a Mini Cooper, so I'd go with the 330i- in RWD of course.
Interesting, now I came from a base suspension 320, to a base suspension 330i and the two are worlds difference. The 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and I know I can take my fave on and off ramps faster. I feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before. Now Rick's GT has the Adaptive suspension and I like it, I wish mine had it.. But overall I can't see how a Mazda 6 would come close to a base 3 series on a road course or figure 8"

Also prices have continued to skyrocket in ELLPS. I know what I bought my Audi A4 for in 1998, and I'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. So ELLPS is more or less out of what I want to pay.

However there are some decently compelling ""mundane"" cars that can be loaded up to levels that approach (and sometimes exceed) ELLPS. If you want the badge then you go ELLPS. If you want much of the actual benefit and to save some cash, then dropping down a market notch is not a bad idea.

I find Audi, BMW and Kia at top almost shocking. Especially Audi. Interestingly enough, VW is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall QC must be much better there. Also, Porsche being closer to VW than to Audi is interesting.

I will believe Chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. And where is Fiat? Off the scale?

Audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's. Where have you been?
Pretty darn consistent at the top right behind Lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. Still, not at Lexus reliability levels yet (or ever).

Kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. One of the reasons I got one, as they surpassed Honda and Acura for a few years now. Audi's QC is most definitely superior to VW's. Has been for a long time, and most Audi's are still made in Europe while VW's in Mexico.

Well, I didn't have much experience with Audi, except my late dad's 2004 A4 TDI (in Poland) that's still with the family, but enough people complained about it even on Edmund's forums, like GG's infamous S4 problems and inept response from the service departments (this was before his even more disastrous CTS when the service guy blamed ""wrong gas"" for for problems with the entertainment system). BTW, I have to say from years of posting, GG looks like a magnet for bad cars.

I'm sure Audi improved, I just found very surprising that they are now at top 3. BTW, I was happy to see BMW also climbing to near top. I wonder if Audi will offer similar warranty to VW (6/72 btb!), or perhaps they're doing well enough and VW is just putting a last ditch effort to salvage the market.

Well, they did tend to have AC issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue). For a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 K warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%. I had a window regulator and AC go bad, and I needed the intake module replaced on my A3 by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the Open sky so you can't break what you don't have).

Getting a big check to reimburse me for the intake module after the fact went a long way towards making me forget some of those minor issues. Still, considering I drove it like I stole it, was a reliable 06 model.

It was no Lexus, but it wasn't a Neon either. For example, the A3 never needed to be towed.

Good point!

Nothing really wrong with the Infiniti. I think they softened it too much. The twin turbo 6 was good. Transmission was a bit lazy, but nothing really wrong with it.

I think I was hoping for more of what the previous generation offered with the 3.7, which was much sportier. Infiniti went in the opposite direction.

I was very lucky to spend 5 days with him back in the early 90's on a motorcycle ""festival"" called The Three Flags, very fascinating person.

4935,tlong,October 2017,How is it that my 12 yo Acura TL looked good and was highly reliable. And yet the new TLX IMHO doesn't look as good and Acura's reliablity is in the dumper according to CR. Not a lot of progress in 12 years.

2013 s4 now has 40k miles - which I bot used in February 14 with 14k miles so for 26k miles thru New England weather and potholes I have yet to have any issues. Tire swaps for the seasons and regular recommended service. My guess at 45k would prob need to do brakes- which will be expensive. Of current Ellps I don't really see any thing that screams by me for the cash - Audi s5 fastback very cool looking BUT 60k is tough. Kia stinger another that's very interesting - BMW for anything with a 6 is way to expensive for that interior.
Many have commented about getting more in average brand cars and I totally agree- badge envy for me is gone- look at the technology and standard safety features you get with a 18 accord. Speaking of accord - sharp looking in sport form and you can still get a Manual (talking to you Audi)"

They shouldn't, but they usually do. As I recall, when dealers first started offering DInan tunes on the N55, it bumped them like 30hp and cost 50% more than the aftermarket units that offered double the power increase. I could be misremembering some details, but I believe that was the gist.

I did raise an objection to the tunes for the S4 (and TTS) for that matter costing more than the A3 tune. The S4's is the most expensive.

I asked if ""the cost was based on the MSRP and assumed bank account of said owners?""

The answer was that there were more 2.0T engines to spread the costs around than 3.0T (supercharged) engines. In fact, the 2.0T is used in VW's like the GTI. The 3.0 was limited to S4, Q5, A6, & A7.

GIAC tuning, which you could get from GIAC
I'm sure they sourced someone for a forged 20"" wheel.
Alcon brake systems, rotors, calipers, and slapped the Stasis name on it.
AWE exhaust, and slapped the Stasis engraving on the tips.
I'm sure the coil-overs and sway bars were outsourced too.

Yeah, then we could cover the entire automotive spectrum with just one thread here at Edmunds.

""Talk about your transportation device - sedan, coupe, wagon, SUV, CUV, truck - whatever""

(and, I'm sure I missed a few categories as well)

I get it, however - one person's definitive list means that another person's choice would be excluded.

4981,dino001,January 2018,"I have to honestly say, I don't care how something is called, whether it's the ""right brand"", or it ""belongs"" to some category. To me important issues are if the vehicle drives right, has right amounts of features, sufficient reliability record of the model or brand and dealerships that don't treat you like an illiterate. It just so happens that those tastes and financial abilities coincide with number of models that are called ELLPS by many.

However, if Kia, Chevrolet, or Toyota came with a vehicle that has the features, handling and styling, I would consider it, regardless if somebody else calls it ELLPS, or not. It just so happens that up to this point their current lineup is aimed at different buyer demographics, but they could change. For example, Kia came up with Stinger, which looks quite ""tasty"" in the first glance. Even with their legendary obnoxious dealerships (at least here in Tampa Bay) with even more annoying commercials, if I were on the market, I would probably hold my nose and at least take a look and ask for a drive. If it checked all the right boxes, I'd take it. Lower price would be just a bonus. And I don't care if Edmunds' panel of discussion board experts considers that vehicle ELLPS, or not.

When it comes to Hyundai/Kia I think we need to be watching them. The first Gen Stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. Give the mid life cycle and next Gen I think the Germans will have problems. For the price of my 330i, I could have bought the top of line Stinger GT and have money leftover and the V6 Stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.

I just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review. They list it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 MPH. Top speed of 167. If that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up NHRA.
To each his own; my personal standard is a sub-thirteen second quarter mile- and my 2er just barely qualifies.. Note that I didn't say the GT was slow, only that it could be a bit quicker. The Stinger GT's performance is solidly average for its class- which isn't bad.

Depending where you look, you might find different numbers. I found 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 quarter miles reported for my '16 TTS. Of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level.

Dino do tell about your 430 GC!!

When it comes to Hyundai/Kia I think we need to be watching them. The first Gen Stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. Give the mid life cycle and next Gen I think the Germans will have problems. For the price of my 330i, I could have bought the top of line Stinger GT and have money leftover and the V6 Stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.

On the other hand, I have fallen in love with the Volvo V90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many Wagons on the road.
The car is great so far. I picked it up in Munich in June, drove south to Switzerland, then southern France (Provance), swept along Cote d’Azur to Milan and back to Munich. Then picked it up in Spartanburg in late Septempebr and drove home to Tampa. Now it’s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect. Have to admit, although I miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent. Even the automatic doesn’t bother me, it’s probably one of the best in the market. The electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early F3x generation, is finally fixed. It’s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328. No longer Buick like. I think they tweaked standard 4-series, including GC to be slightly more sporty than standard 3. The standard suspension is also quite alright. I got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don’t feel like missing anything.

In other words, the car is just fine with my growing up and getting stiffer in the joints, but maintains most important aspects of the handling. And there is that rear hatch

So the Stinger looks like a legitimate effort from Kia. Let’s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market. If it is 5-series size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged V6 may be ok, considering Kia always throws in decent cash incentives. Low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that’s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too. One knock against is the mpg on GT, when you compare it with, say BMW’s 3.0 six turbo. It souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech. It may be a positive for some.

Having a bit of trouble with passenger volumes of the BMWs, but here is what I was able to dig up. Interestingly, the 3'er has more front leg room than the 5'er. Stinger trumps both. Rear leg room is within a tenth of an inch between the 5'er and Stinger.

The N/A straight six had a great sound. Beautiful, I loved it. But in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s. My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability. Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers. Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far. We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six. Those four cylinders are still building the record. One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines. Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers.

They really did like the A5 Sportback. What amazes me, is the A4 is significantly lighter than the A5 Sportback, and is essentially the same car. The sportback might be tuned a bit more aggressively suspension-wise though than the ""family"" sedan.

That's my worry as well, not to mention potential warranty hassles if I took a Stinger to an HPDE. At least you can get it in RWD. Having said all that, my usual strategy of buying a 2-3 year old CPO works great for me, the only downside being the ability to tailor a car to my exact specs- for example if I had ordered my F22 it would have had a red interior, PDC, and no hole in the roof- but the $15,000 savings compensates for the ""imperfections.""

Yes, but in order to really save 14K you'd have to have a car with similar specs and performance, now, you could argue your getting somewhere around 9/10th's for 8/10th's cost. As with everything, there is a law of diminishing returns.

So I went and built a Stinger 2.0 RWD and a BMW 330i, I believe they are as close as you can get, and there is a 7K difference. Now if you pick 4 series then it's close to 9K difference.

On the other hand, it could be judged heavier and less dynamic than the 3'er yet hold its own or be better than the 5'er in those areas. Also, of course, WAY cheaper than a comparable 5.

so doing the math, your saying about 1% make it a decision issue?

While probably accurate, I'd argue the percentage where it does matter is higher. Weight (less of it) assists in better handling, ride, acceleration, fuel economy, and braking. Lighter cars simply feel more toss-able. Those seeking sporty handling will notice it, even if they don't look at spec sheets.

Rick and I stopped and looked a Stinger, it was a GT-1 V6 RWD, MSRP 46K, with all the features and options on this car a BMW 4 series 440i GC would be in the low 60's. It was very roomy in the rear seat, but getting in and out was a PIA. We didn't drive it, but for a 14K difference, I'm not too sure if paying the difference is worth it. The fit and finish was first rate, the salesman needed more training or he got his Audi models confused, he kept saying the Stinger competed against the A8.

Stopped by the Volvo dealer, and was shocked a V90 (wagon) on the lot, according to the salesman, someone ordered it and decided to take a V60 instead. Not too sure why the interior of that V90 was stunning. 55K fully loaded. What a deal, an MB E400 wagon starts at 59K. Volvo has a hit, not too sure why the V90 wagon (not to get confused by the Cross Country) is special order only car."

From what I've read, it doesn't look like Kia will be able to convert the BMW/Audi/MB/Infiniti clientele to give the Stinger a second look, much less a first one.

But, for folks who haven't driven those brands on a regular basis (like me), would we be impressed enough with the drive / feel / interior materials enough to consider it?

Not that I'm in the market for a $30-50K vehicle like this, but just wondering ....

Kia has changed up the calculus of their lease programs - high MF, low residual but high lease cash.

For 36 months and 12,000 miles per year, MF ranges between .00195 and .00200, residuals between 50-54%, and lease cast between $4800-7200

""Kia moved 1,378 Stingers in April of 2018, for a total of 5,298 for the year. Compare that with the A5/S5/RS5, which sold a total of 2,169 in April and 8,243 for the year."""

The GT has power, and it handles well, but I think we all know that Kia's do not hold value, I would wait for one to come off lease and be able to pick up a GT2 for about 23-25K."

Any thoughts yet................ Pro's / Cons going from the Accord to a TLX.
Huge difference. Wish I'd done it before. Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho.

On the TLX 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an Accord to me—although how you get there is different. At first acceleration seems faster in the TLX in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. This is all in ""Normal"" mode. I think I might try Sport for a while and see what that's like. The TLX's 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the Accord's engine that's made to take advantage of premium gas.

But aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an Accord. For the most part, you can't even tell that there's any relation between the two cars. The steering with PAWS is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a CVT, the leather seats feel as comfortable and supportive as those of the new BMW I was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it's still really comfortable), etc. And the the sound system is beyond anything Honda offers, and maybe even better than what's offered in a comparable BMW or Lexus.

Kia had a ""Stinger Experience"" here in Phoenix 2 months back and Rick and I went. It was very interesting they had 3 Kia Stinger GT RWD and 3 with AWD. They also had a BMW 640i GC, Audi A5, Porsche Panamera and another car I can't remember. You drive the ""other"" car first around a road course, then you pick a GT to drive, there are three laps, the last lap was driven by one of the ""Professional"" drivers. I got the Audi A5 and it was a dog, Rick got the 640 and loved it.

The GT has power, and it handles well, but I think we all know that Kia's do not hold value, I would wait for one to come off lease and be able to pick up a GT2 for about 23-25K.
Just curious, do you remember if the A5 was FWD or quattro? The other thing that wouldn't surprise me is if they put low octane fuel in a high octane competitor.

Or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. And before folks jump up and down on me, I'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here.

If one follows CR one knows Kia has been rocking it pretty well in the reliability department in recent time. My Kia experience mirrors CR's ratings, yet again. CR always hits it out of the park for me.

We just laugh at him and kid him about it - he also criticizes our driving (the other guy's driving, because I pretty much agree with him about this) as far as lane change procedures, putting on our turn signals correctly, etc. He's a stickler for driving accuracy, and, in those matters, I agree with him. I hate it when I'm turning right, for instance, and somebody behind me turns right, but goes around me right into the left lane without turning first into the right lane. I agree with him, that's not how the driver's guide teaches a person when they're first learning how to drive. And how they first teach you goes for lifetime driving.

But he's got an old Cadillac Catera RWD that he fixes or has repaired often. Loves it so much. And he's as feisty as Geronimo was dealing with the US Cavalry regarding how much better a RWD car is over a FWD.

5134,benjaminh,July 2018,"The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car.

I've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry I ever read is called ""Car: A Drama of the American Workplace"" by Mary Walton, published in 1999. This book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation Taurus, which Ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. Anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. Ford was trying to make the 1996 Taurus a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. When the 2nd gen Taurus flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.

Since I read that I've been even more aware than I was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. Sitting in a rental Hyundai Sonata, for instance, I could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the Honda Accords I used to own.

And now with my new TLX, I can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a Honda. For instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the TLX that a Honda just doesn't have. This is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. The adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the Acura when compared with my wife's new CR-V with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.

Again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedans need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free.""

I do not find it attractive at all. The previous version was far better looking IMO, and inside, this one is not good at all. As a GM fan this car is a huge disappointment. Top that off with performance that is mid-pack at best and I suspect the model may not make it to the end of its 4-year production contract with PSA at the former GM plant in Russelsheim, at least for North American markets.

It has been several years since I last used a spare tire. And then, bang, last Saturday, blow out on my minivan. I hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was. My wife (now ex) used AAA and other ""road service"" (USAA insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours.

It took me about 15 minutes to get back on the road Saturday, and I thought that was rather long actually. Unfamiliarity with the mid-mounted spare, I actually had to dig out the owner's manual. IT guys really hate to RTFM.

Fix a flat doesn't cut it, in my opinion. This incident Saturday, there was a hole in the sidewall. I don't think any amount of ""goop"" would have done the trick.

I see now where some new cars offer a spare tire as an ""optional, extra cost item"". Is that your situation, @benjaminh ? If so, I would cough up the bucks.

I believe the TLX (at least prior to 2018 redesign) had a spare as an option. The ILX definitely did. Heck, if you pulled out the tray insert, the bracket with the screw hole to attach the tire bold was already there. And at one point they listed it as an accessory option on the build it page.

the new RDX at least still has a spare. I would have to check a TLX to see if the tire well is still there.

Because of good luck, good maintenance, and good tires, somehow I don't recall that we've had a flat in the last 7 or 8 years in either my wife's car or my car. My wife's new CR-V has a full-size spare, which is something I haven't seen in a long time. Interesting that our two new cars in their own ways go to extremes on this. @stickguy it's not clear to me if a spare would even fit in the TLX. Maybe those plastic trays can be removed? Not sure. Honestly it doesn't look like it. They seem well built and built-in.

Anyway, you get a pressure sensor on each tire on the TLX. And here's a pic of some of the controls and buttons that are better than on my wife's CR-V.

Yes, the TLX is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 Accords. This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much.

And tonight, I'll confess, I took another pleasure cruise in the TLX—although first I had to go to the gas station to get my first fill-up of premium. And yes, they told me at the Acura dealer that using regular won't hurt your engine, but honestly why would you sacrifice c. 20 horsepower with a car that's designed to use every horse it has. My feeling is that if you aren't going to put premium in a premium car when it's recommended that maybe you should get something else?

Anyway, the lower mpg of 22 was my c. 3 miles of stop and go traffic to the Costco gas station for my premium fill up.

And don't get excited about that upper mpg of 40. I think it's valid (although I need to check with this tank how accurate the mpg meter is), but this was a highway run of about 20 miles with light traffic going an almost steady c. 60-62 mph, although with the AC on fairly high and the car in Sport mode. This was on a series of 55 mph freeways around Louisville. So it's seemingly good mpg, but the reality is I'm usually going more like c.72 mph on 70 mph freeways back and forth between Louisville and Lexington. But if it's accurate, 40 mpg is about as high as I would have gotten in my Accord for this run.



@sda : You might check out a TLX, esp. if you can find one of the last of the 2018s. For a last generation Accord owner imho the TLX Tech a big upgrade, really a wow. I'm still getting lots of smiles from the four wheel steering. And the ELS stereo is really great for listening to SiriusXM and CDs.

I was cruising down Interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go. This was well out in the country, on the approach to the Brazos River bridge, actually. The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep. That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack. I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did. Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack.

I got the lug nuts off, but the aluminum wheel had welded itself to the hub. I looked around, found a big chunk of concrete, and used that to try and break the wheel loose. I’m laying under the truck, whacking the back side of the wheel with the concrete chunk, and an 18 wheel tractor trailer comes whizzing by at 80 mph. Sliding by my parked, jacked up truck by about 18 inches, maybe less. So naturally the truck sways back and forth on that tiny bottle jack and I’m thinking, “What a way to die. Crushed under a damned truck trying to fix a flat tire.”

There was another occasion. Not dangerous, but embarrassing. I was pulling the 5th wheel and had a blow out. If you’ve ever owned a travel trailer, then you will already know that they tend to eat tires. I looked around for a good place to get off the road, and spotted some kind of business with a big empty parking lot and pulled in. I’m jacking up the travel trailer (I always carried a really good jack with that thing), and my wife comes around and says, “You realize this is a funeral home, right?”

I look around, and she’s right, it’s a funeral home. I tell her it doesn’t matter, no one is there. Except … They obviously had a service of some kind scheduled, and the parking lot starts filling up. I swear it didn’t take me more than 10 minutes to swap out that tire, but in that 10 minutes the parking lot went from empty to full. And every single person who came in was looking at me like I was transgressing against their dead relative.

I'll just live on the wild side when it comes to spare tires (or lack) and see what happens. No doubt I'll let you know and cry uncle if somehow disaster strikes. But my guess is that the odds of a flat are low on the roads I drive. My second guess is that if I get one the fix-a-flat might work to get me to the gas station. My third guess is that even if a AAA tow truck has to take me to the gas station I'll be ok with it, since I've done that before a few times and it's not a big deal imho. Other things being equal I'd take a spare, but given how much I like almost everything else about the TLX I doubt I'll miss it much. Again, we'll see. I might end up eating my words....

If its the 3.6, it should be way better than 6.5. I think it may be the 2.0T, unless I'm getting my ATS owners mixed up.

I thought I'd take a significant mpg hit for moving from an Accord to an Acura, but if the mpg meter on the new TLX is accurate the mpg is very similar. I got c.36 mpg on the way over and c.38 mpg on the way back. This is a c.80 mile drive with AC on going c.70-75 mph. I know I'm getting premium gas instead of regular, but I'm still impressed that mpg is the same as a CVT car that weighs c.200 lbs less....

I drove 225 miles with 6.4 gallons, which gives an average of 35.15 mpg for c. 85% highway driving—which is quite good. The only problem is that my trip computer said that I got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. Hmmm. I thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my Accord's, were maybe a little too good to be true. But the real number is still better than I expected, esp. given that the EPA highway rating on the TLX 2.4 is 33.

My son the engineer/computer coder said that my method of manually checking the mpg could have a margin of error as well. Who is to say that the shut of works exactly the same each time, or that you have the filler in the same amount? I guess he has a point? In any case, I'll try to remember to test it again manually on the next tank and see what I get.

Bottom line is that I'm still happy with the mpg of the TLX 2.4. On the highway seems just as good as an Accord 2.4.

There is also an adjustable thigh support (the front part of the cushion is separate and can move in and out) but again I notice little difference. Maybe a smaller person would appreciate these things more than I do. I am probably not the best judge of seats. To me the most comfortable seats of any car I ever had were in my '09 Lacrosse, which were the standard 8-way power adjustable leather thrones. They were cushy and soft with very pliable leather so you sunk into them and with the adjustment set correctly they were just about perfect. I remember being disappointed when I traded it on the 2011 Regal and had lived with it for a while at how hard those seats were and how stiff the leather seemed in comparison.

I think that KBB review is ""fair."" The TLX just isn't a real sports sedan. If you bought one thinking you'll go canyon carving with your BMW and Audi friends, you may be disappointed. If you got one thinking you got the better Accord, chances are you'll be happy.

The funny thing is there are a lot of cars that can keep up on the Angeles Crest Highway (ACH). You don't have to spend $200K on a Porsche to keep up. A lot of people in LA do put a few mods on their cars though.

Canyon carving, like any task, requires having the right tool for the job. That being said, most of the cars carving canyons on the weekend are not getting anywhere near the fuel economy of the TLX @benjaminh is getting.

That's an inappropriate tire for an A-spec model.

Changing out the tire to something like a Michelin Pilot Super Sport 4S would probably make the car twice as fun in the canyons, literally. I'm not exaggerating.

I'm sure the tires were the source of criticism in that review. You never get a 2nd chance to make a first impression.

My 330i will run the 1/4 in 13 sec's and about 100. 0-60 times in the high 5's (stock) drop a stage 1 onto (like I did) 0-60 in the mid 5 to low 5, and 1/4 times and speed goes up. We have a neighbor who has his new M5 w/comp package on order and all he talks about is how fast it goes. Some of us are betting that an accident will happen shortly after he gets it."

5228,henryn,July 2018,"I am forced to agree. A 12 second quarter mile is an impressive thing, but I doubt I will ever again do that. Or at least it would be a very rare occurrence. But I do like acceleration.

When I'm coming up the freeway on ramp, spot a hole in the traffic, punch it, and the car lunges forward, I mean really jumps -- yeah, I like that. Yes, I will pay extra for that.

But the difference in 1/4 mile times between the Kia and the Alfa -- not going to matter in my world. Both of them will jump just fine, more than enough for me.

A few years back, when I was seriously considering a used Genesis, I did several test drives. Both 6 cylinder models and V8's. The guy who wrote the review for Edmunds said you didn't need the V8, it would only be for bragging rights. A conclusion which I vehemently disagreed with.

I alternate two daily drivers, a Town and Country and an F150 with an Ecoboost. The Town and County is fast enough, it will get out of it's own way. But you have to punch it, wait for the downshift, wait for the engine to spool up, and THEN it will move pretty good. The Ecoboost, lightly touch the throttle and you are moving!

Ben in the BMW world, it was not unheard of getting a new BMW lease for 1% of MSRP, that was a good indicator that you got a good deal. When I was looking to replace my 320i, I was offered V6 TLXs for under 1%, reason, they weren't selling... Would you share your deal you got on your TLX?

My 2016 Accord CVT was rated 36 on the highway—and that's about what I got. Sometimes I got a 1-2 mpg more, sometimes 1-2 mpg less, and sometimes right on.

Overall, I like my new TLX a lot. Really a lot. In almost every way it's better than my 2016 Accord—which itself was the best car I'd ever owned up until I got the TLX. Cars, unlike some things in life, really can get better than in the old days.

The suspension is one of the things that impresses me about the TLX. It's controlled and yet comfortable, seemingly getting a nearly perfect mix of sporty and luxurious, but with a slight emphasis on the former.

I would say for sure a DCT is more efficient than a lowly CVT, but a DCT with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems Acura found a good middle ground. There's a reason many people won't consider a car with a CVT, even if Honda does it better than just about anyone.

I may not be, but it's nice. I just drove a rental TDI in Scotland for a week and I didn't feel much deprived vs. my 430 GC. The vehicle was a relative base (cloth seats, no Nav), but the overall level of equipment, fit and finish was quite good. Despite being FWD, it was nicely responsive, but I have to admit, the ""spritited"" handling was last thing on my mind there, as I was more focused on not hitting anything and constantly fighting my cross-wired senses (left is right, right is left). Nevertheless, it would have been quite good substitute if you didn't want to shell out as much money. Of course I didn't like that diesel's characteristics as much as my gas engine, but it wasn't a tractor, as say my late dad's 2005 A4 TDI.

There's a good aftermarket tune for those old TDI's. I experienced one in a loaner bug at my preferred shop. Of course, it might be spewing 80X the current standard emissions now.

I don't really understand the question, but I'm the last one to place some kind strict categories with a checklist. People buy whatever they want and if they want to cross shop Escalade with Mazda Miata, it's weird, but it's their privilege. All I just meant to say my dad's A4 TDI is loud (it's still in the family, my nephey has it) at highway speeds and you definitely know it's a downsized tractor engine with slightly better vibration dampening and noise insulation good enough for you hear the radio at somewhat loud setting. Europeans liked those TDIs and Benz's old (slow, noisy and clunky) diesels long years before they bought into the ""diesel will save the planet and we just have it in our showroom"" lie, luxury or not.

A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year.

But the 4-wheel steering on the TLX is enjoyable. I worry now that I won't want a car without this feature in the future. But given that Acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while.

I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me). I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it.

Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both.

Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that.

The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle.

The A4 is also a very nice design, and the Audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. The TLX is close, but I do think that the Acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? I'm getting used to it, but I think the styling details on the Audi are very nice.

I guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the ILX, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 Civic ever. Still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. It's close to the same price as leasing a Civic.

Your 2013 Accord EX might be worth c. $11-12k at trade-in, which obviously means that you have a big downpayment. Would you lean toward leasing or buying?

For entry-level luxury cars the lease deals seem better than the purchase deals.

What happens when you like driving your new car too much? In just five weeks of ownership I've put c.3300 miles on it on my newly leased TLX Tech. I love the handling, the stereo, the engine, the transmission, the seats, etc. And so I've been going on lots of fun trips to see old friends, driven to sites in town I haven't seen, and I've also been driving to cities I've never before visited. Since I'm a prof. (which perhaps explains a few things) once the school year starts in a couple of weeks I won't be driving so much since I'll be working all the time. So that should slow down the miles, and then I'll also probably start driving my wife's new CR-V sometimes when going back and forth to Lexington.

5295,benjaminh,August 2018,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX.

For the entry-level model TLX probably some are cross-shopping the Accord EXL 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. So one way to look at it would be what does the TLX base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an Accord EXL.

Here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the TLX are worth to me personally over an Accord EXL....

The exclusive 4-wheel steering of the TLX would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. The 4WS really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. Great system imho.

The 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the Accord's CVT.

The better suspension of the TLX compared to the Accord is worth at least $500 to me.

The quieter ride of the TLX is also worth about $500 to me.

The TLX's better and bigger brakes with their ""Premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. Plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the TLX than the strange designs found on the Accord.

The longer Acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. And the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.

The nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the TLX, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that.

Very subjectively to me then the TLX does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable Accord, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal. And with the lease incentives Acura offers it doesn't seem like you even pay that....?

I teach art history—and I really enjoy it!

I think the standard audio in the TLX is similar to the top-of-the-line system in the Accord EXL/Touring. So it's a very good system that's quite a bit better than what you and I hear/heard in our EXs. The ELS takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that Honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? In terms of the leatherette, I would have been happy with that too. In fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.

The seating position in the TLX is just slightly lower than in my 2016 Accord.

But like you I did find the seating position of the 2018 Accord maybe a little too low.

I do enjoy the Tech features, but if they had had a TLX base on the lot I might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the Tech. It happened that it was the very last TLX 2.4 they had.

I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class. When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors. One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII. The stories and insight that she shared, wow. I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't.

To stay on topic: I see more and more TLXs on the road. For first generation it is hard to tell the 2.4 from the V6, with the rim style/tire size being the real give away. Goodyear tires on the 2.4, Bridgestone tires on the V6.

I've been thinning out my CD collection over the last ten years, but thank goodness I still saved c. 150 favorites! I'm planning to start downloading them to the car each week as I drive.
That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time. I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home. Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks.

5304,henryn,August 2018,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back. I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond. No more, never again, thank you very much. And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs. All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore. In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip. These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist. Some things do get better.

And I will extend that to cars. Yes, cars really are a lot better. Faster, cleaner, MUCH longer lasting. If I don't enjoy them as much (although I still do enjoy, just not as much), then I attribute that to being a grouchy old man.

May I suggest you check out a copy of the book ""The Revenge of Analog"" from your local library?

Goes into detail about the revival of things like vinyl, books, board games, notebooks and the like. Great read.

Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination.

PS Now that I've driven both the TLX and my wife's CR-V a lot, I've decided I like non-turbo engines slightly better. The 1.5T on the CR-V does have maybe a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. And so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.

PPS My guess is that the next generation TLX, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. I'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4WS. Right now I am hoping to finance the residual on the TLX when the lease is up, if we can afford it at that time. It's a really nice car that I'd like to keep long-term.

Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem.

My guess is that the delay is more due to programming and transmission ineptitude than on the turbo lag. Does the CVT make an appearance in the CRV?

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."

Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone.

I'm not sure if I'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if I did this TLX would be the car for that. So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty.

We love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. We use that a lot, actually. And the CR-V is also fun to drive. Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX."
5347,benjaminhf,September 2018,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time.

In terms of handling, even my wife has said she really likes the way the TLX drives. She likes the 4-wheel steering (although it took her a couple of months to actually feel it), the handling, and the smooth power."

2020 Acura RDX tech SH-AWD, 2023 Maverick hybrid Lariat luxury package."
5366,benjaminhf,October 2018,"But falling sales for ELL cars probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....

Perhaps I'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ELLs won't really be available. Currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, according to BMW, of 7.1 seconds. The Acura TLX 2.4 I have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 Accord CVT). But for the new generation of 3-series coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. So the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. Rumors are that the all-new 2020 Acura TLX will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.

That's probably what almost all ELL buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive 3-series starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it.

And I'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac I can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 TLX with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. I don't think a 2020 TLX with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously I don't know for sure. I assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 TLX. I could afford the current TLX, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....

Finally, if you really are trying to keep a car past 10 years and 100k miles, then perhaps a naturally aspirated engine might be more reliable in the long run?"

Yeah, given falling sales for almost all entry-level cars, Acura might not have much room to raise prices.

Here's my guess....the msrp for the base model 2020 TLX might only go up by c.$2k or so, but at the same time (as with the Accord) they will really cut back on lease incentives. In other words, my guess is that the ""real"" price increase might be more like $5k—almost the same price increase as for the BMW 330i—although like today a TLX will still undercut a comparable 330i by thousands of collars. My lease deal was almost too good, in that I could lease a TLX 2.4 Tech for less than an Accord EXL 2.4. I think that will almost certainly not be possible for the 2020 TLX."

And so really it's a price cut of about $3500, which shows how much Acura hopes to get some sales. The ILX is now seemingly a good deal for the money, esp compared to say an Audi A3, which comparably equipped costs almost $10k more. The base msrp of the ILX is now $25,900. Unfortunately Acura didn't put CarPlay/AndroidAuto into the base model. But for $27,650 you can get the ILX Premium which adds CarPlay/AA, leather seats, upgraded stereo, power passenger seat, BLIS, built-in garage door opener, etc.

My guess is that they are hoping to cut the lease incentive. But that means the monthly payments will probably be about the same as with the 2018s—c. $200 a month+ taxes and so on with c.$2500 das. In other words, only c.$30 a month and c.$500 more das than a lease on a Civic LX. But that's the best case scenario for the base model. The ILX Premium would obviously be a bit more...."

5376,benjaminhf,October 2018,"Currently there seems to be a $5000+ lease incentive on the last of the 2018 ILXs. But if you wait just a few months you can probably get almost as good a deal on one of the 2019s. Sedans just aren't selling, as you know, and so it's a buyer's market. I bet your local Acura dealer would give you top dollar for your Elantra Sport if you're willing to walk away. But imho the TLX is really the better car. I'd take a base TLX with the 4-wheel steering, slightly more room, etc., etc. over a loaded ILX. If you are considering the ILX, the new style will almost certainly have better resale value."
5377,stickguy,October 2018,"I would have to drive them back to back. I do find the ILX to be a better size for normal driving, though the extra room is nice when travelling, and the wife prefers a bigger car. So a TLX would be OK. no bigger than the Sonata I had was.

5378,benjaminhf,October 2018,"By the end of December I bet they will already be dealing on the 2019 ILXs. The ILX premium with the restyle and the $3.5k price cut is a good msrp. If you can get a good lease incentive of c.3k or so on top of that it should be a nice price/payment overall. The trick is the resale on your Elantra Sport. As you know, once I said I couldn't afford the TLX and it was clear I was willing to walk away, the trade-in offer on my 2016 Accord suddenly increased by quite a bit. I think you might get more from an Acura dealer for the Elantra Sport than from Carvana, esp. if you go in at the end of the sales period (end of Dec.?). They mentioned to me a few times that mine was one of the sales that put them over the top for their sales goal which helped them get a bit of a bonus from corporate."

Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car.
I just had a former Ford service advisor come to work for me in another industry. The subject of warranties came up, and he mentioned how Ford Focus RS owner's would come to him after obviously ""abusing"" their launch control button. IT was funny because his attitude wasn't like mine, which is ""why put a button or feature if the car can't handle it?"" His attitude was more like, the launch control is just for marketing, and you really shouldn't be using it if you wanted warranty covered.

I simply mentioned how Audi didn't really care, at least at the dealers I'd been too, and he admitted he's heard Ford is more ""stuck up"" than others, and heard/noticed that Honda will cover just about anything. He's a young guy so I'm sure he was just taking orders and instruction/training from more Senior Ford officials.

This confirms the stories you've heard about Ford voiding any reasonable honor of warranty.

With sales of the ILX last month down to 930 cars, I'd say the writing is probably on the wall. Acura saved at least a billion dollars by keeping the 2019 ILX on the 2012 Civic platform rather than making an all-new car with the 2016 Civic platform—and they've passed that savings on to the customer. But unless sales somehow explode my guess is that we're only a few years away from the end of the ILX. We'll see.

One weird little factoid is that when the ILX was first introduced for model year 2013 the list price for the base model was $25,900. And now six years later the base price of the ILX is again exactly the same—$25,900. But the 2013 ILX had the comparatively underpowered 2.0 engine as well as a lackluster 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2019 ILX has the TLX's 2.4 plus the TLX's 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Plus the 2019 ILX has a better interior than the 2013, a quieter ride, AcuraWatch, etc. When you account for inflation 25,900 in today's dollars would be about 29k. In other words, the 2019 ILX is a much better car with a huge price cut from 2013. But it's still difficult to get around the fact that it's a massively updated and improved 6-year old car—even if the price is now pretty compelling. Perhaps another upside is that it should be completely debugged. That seems to be the case with my 2018 TLX too."
5384,stickguy,October 2018,"I saw yesterday there is supposed to be an all new (I assume accord, or RDX platform, based) 2020 TLX. Would not surprise me if they consolidated the current T and I into one sedan model, with trim levels, but added a compact CUV to replace the entry level ILX

The ILX is almost exactly the same size as a 320i, but gets from 0-60 in c.6.6 seconds compared to 7.1 for the 320i. Get real people to beat a 320i in a drag race to 60 with an ILX. Then compare the red leather in the ILX vs. vinyl in the 320i, as well as all the things the 320i lacks without options—no moonroof, no adaptive cruise control, no CarPlay/AA, $550 extra for any color beyond white, etc. In fact if you skip the A-spec, which is mostly an appearance package, the ILX Tech now lists for $29,550—$5k less than a stripper 320i."

5394,benjaminhf,October 2018,"@stickguy imho the ILX you might consider is the step above the Premium, which is the Tech. The most important addition at that level is the ELS sound system. It lists for c. $29.5k. But wait for several months, or even the end of the model year, and there are likely to be big discounts and incentives.

Of course, you could also consider waiting for the new, smaller than RDX SUV. My guess is that it'll be introduced for model year 2020, perhaps with a starting msrp of about $31k for the 2-wheel drive version. Of course if you need BLIS and other goodies it'll probably be more like 34K. Still, it's probably going to be a good value for the money—and it will almost certainly have much better resale value than the ILX. The related flip side of that, of course, is that huge discounts on the ILX are sometimes possible, but no such thing is likely for this new SUV."

But since for just a little more than a Civic you can lease a base ILX it's arguably a good deal for bargain-minded customers who want a reliable and nice performing car with some luxury that's almost $10k less than the competition (when similarly optioned).

I'm in Seattle right now, and the local Audi dealer has an advertised lease on a base FWD A3 for $350 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $3250 due at signing. The A3 is a better car in some ways than an Acura ILX, but the base ILX can be leased for $200 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $2500 das. If you can pay an extra $150 a month and an extra $750 down the A3 is a better looking car imho with better performance.

Interesting, I was running the 1/8th Friday Night with Race Legal (my first time ever heading over to Qualcomm to race in a straight line on a Friday night! The TTS Stage 1 was doing 7.9's, with just a measely 350 HP. The benefits of quattro AWD are very apparent in a 1/8 mile race. Especially since Qualcomm isn't a real track, and is just a parking lot conversion, and a parking lot in disrepair at that. Grip is a problem for the 2WD vehicles.

Anyway, the most interesting race was me vs. either a Hellcat or Demon, hard to tell them apart. I actually had an end time advantage by .001 seconds, but my reaction time was about .l5 slower so I lost. I was way ahead, and at the finish line they past me like I was standing still. They hit triple digits while I couldn't ever even hit 90.

Perhaps.

But having gotten dirty and sweaty changing tires in the 70s, 80s and 90s I don't want to get my clothes dirty now doing that either. I'm done with that. If the fix a flat machine doesn't do it, I'll just get towed and get a new tire. But maybe I won't get a flat. We'll see. My wife and I haven't had a flat in any of our various cars in our 2-car family for more than 10 years iirc. I don't know if that's just luck or if it's also that tires are better now?

The 2019 S60 is up on their website now. That price of 40k is for the new one. It does look like a great car. If you can stay away from most options it seems like a really good price for that level of car. A little bit difficult for me to get that any color aside from black costs $650 more, but I guess BMW has been doing that for many years—although iirc BMW at least offers white for free as well.

Yeah, Hyundai has bollocked up the Genesis brand.

Initially sold at Hyundai dealers, corporate then decided that there would be separate showrooms, but only in major markets (I think a couple hundred dealers, max).

Then - WAIT! - corporate then reversed course and said that it would be OK to continue selling the Genesis brand through existing Hyundai stores.

The store where I picked up my Elantra GT a few years back sells Genesis. But, the store itself is a bit dated; not someplace where I would want to purchase or lease my $50,000 (or up) luxury vehicle. I'd expect a more Acura / Infiniti / Lexus like environment and experience.

Agree about Genesis not really fitting well with being sold through Hyundai.

The Stinger is actually a hatchback. Although the underpinnings and engine are shared with the G70, I think the sheetmetal and interiors are different. But yes, in a sense the Stinger is the ""bargain"" G70. Looking at cars.com I saw that you can buy a brand new Stinger for c. $29k, which seems like a good deal. But then that Savage Geese reviewer complained about multiple squeaks and rattles and so it seems like they are having some quality issues.

One thing I've been enjoying about my leased TLX is that it seems so far flawless in terms of quality. Honda is good, but the Acura does seem almost like a different world.

If discount is big enough and you keep it long enough, the depreciation becomes a non-issue four-five years down the road, as your starting point is the lower transaction price, not the sticker. If it’s a good lease, then the manufacturer takes the bath, not the driver.

Another good advantage of buying an outgoing model is usually they work out most of the obvious flaws and kinks by then, so reliability should be at least OK. Also, the support from independent shops should be alright, as the model is well known to the technicians. New models, on the other hand, have always risk of “teething” issues, sometimes can be quite annoying and even manufacturers can fall behind on part availability, if particular failures turn to be more widespread than anticipated.

The TLX has more back seat room than an ATS, but less than an Accord.

As you'll recall, I traded in a 2016 Accord EX for my 2018 TLX. On the off chance it might useful here are a lot of things that are better about the TLX compared with an Accord EX, as well as a couple of things that aren't as good.

1. The TLX has an amazing sound system compared to an Accord EX
2. The TLX has a much quieter ride over rough pavement
3. Better handling and suspension—both more sporty and more comfortable
4. Great 4-wheel steering system, which is exclusive in this class
5. AcuraWatch safety systems + adaptive cruise control
6. Better and more comfortable seats
7. Nicer interior materials, switches, and controls
8. Lights in places like under the center console, in the glovebox, etc.
9. Fully finished trunk with special storage areas
10. CarPlay/Android Auto
11. 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter and paddle shifters. Really nice transmission.
12. More refined and more powerful engine
13. Integrated dynamic drive mode selector—econ, normal, sport, sport+
14. Stronger brakes, bigger brake pads, etc.
15. full led headlights provide better and more even illumination, save power, and have longer life
16. All sorts of other details not found on an Accord EX of your year, including capless fuel filler, acoustic glass, reverse tilt down side mirrors, built in compass, longer warranty, etc., etc.

A couple of things that aren't as good include a somewhat smaller back seat area (although still good enough for all but adults over 6' imho), and the fact that the TLX needs premium fuel to make the extra 20 horsepower it has compared to an Accord of the last generation.

Yes, I did test the new Accord. Tougher call there. The new Accord is pretty impressive, but....

Material quality in the TLX is a lot better than even in this generation of Accord. Here's one example that stood out for me. The dial on the steering wheel of the new Accord is clearly copied from the Acura, but it's cheap feeling, and the movement isn't particularly refined. On the Acura this control is really great in term of feel and ease of use. They look almost the same, but big difference in feel and operation. You can find differences like that in a dozen or more things just on the inside.

There's more room in the back seat and in the trunk of the Accord, but in most other ways the TLX is better and nicer.

Finally, with the lease incentives on the TLX, you can probably lease the Acura for less than a comparable Honda Accord.

The Acura TLX, in contrast, is just a nice looking vehicle all around. There's also a lot of variety with the TLX. My lunar silver 4-cylinder is an almost modest looking luxury car, with hidden dual exhaust and somewhat understated details. But for people who own a TLX with the V-6 there are big exhaust finishers and other details that make the car pop. For me the more restrained look works just fine, perhaps because I'm in my 50s and a college prof?

1. The TLX has an amazing sound system compared to an Accord EX
2. The TLX has a much quieter ride over rough pavement
3. Better handling and suspension—both more sporty and more comfortable
4. Great 4-wheel steering system, which is exclusive in this class
5. AcuraWatch safety systems + adaptive cruise control
6. Better and more comfortable seats
7. Nicer interior materials, switches, and controls
8. Lights in places like under the center console, in the glovebox, etc.
9. Fully finished trunk with special storage areas
10. CarPlay/Android Auto
11. 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter and paddle shifters. Really nice transmission.
12. More refined and more powerful engine
13. Integrated dynamic drive mode selector—econ, normal, sport, sport+
14. Stronger brakes, bigger brake pads, etc.
15. full led headlights provide better and more even illumination, save power, and have longer life
16. All sorts of other details not found on an Accord EX of your year, including capless fuel filler, acoustic glass, reverse tilt down side mirrors, built in compass, longer warranty, etc., etc.

A couple of things that aren't as good include a somewhat smaller back seat area (although still good enough for all but adults over 6' imho), and the fact that the TLX needs premium fuel to make the extra 20 horsepower it has compared to an Accord of the last generation.
All good points, and is on my list. Ideally a CPO 18 Tech. I believe you can use regular fuel with very little difference in performance and no risk of engine damage. The lack of a spare tire is a minor negative. I do like the conservative styling that will age well, and higher stance than the current 18 Accord.

5506,stickguy,October 2018,"if there is a difference on RUG, you are only going to see it at high revs. I doubt for normal use you will ever notice. I go back and forth with it in our RDX, and I have never been able to tell. and some of my best MPG tanks have been on RUG.

there actually is an option for a spare. Almost positive it was an actual accessory listed at one point on the TLX, though possible they changes something for 2018. I remember looking in the ILX trunk (I think) and if you took out the Styrofoam tray that held the inflater the flange to bolt the spare tire to was still there. Ben should pull that out of his car and check for us!

2018 Acura TLX 2.4 Tech 4WS (mine), 2018 Honda CR-V EX AWD (wife's)"
5509,benjaminh,October 2018,"Here's are some 2-cent thoughts about putting premium gas in the TLX 2.4. Unlike stickguy's RDX—which has huge amounts of power and a great power to weight ratio—the 2.4 in the TLX is honestly just enough. If an RDX uses regular gas and loses maybe 5-10% of its power there's still plenty left over. But the TLX base weighs 3505 pounds, compared to I think about 3200 pounds for a 2013 Accord EX. In other words, if you lose maybe 5-10% of your horsepower by going to regular it's a definite hit.

The last generation Accord's 2.4 and the current TLX 2.4 are similar engines, but they aren't identical. First, with the TLX 2.4....

""To maximize power output, the 2.4-liter engine has a dual-stage intake manifold has two different intake runner lengths that are selected based on the operating conditions. An actuator and a set of four butterfly valves control the intake runner switching process. At low engine speeds, the long runners are used to improve low-end torque. At higher engine speeds the system switches to the short intake runners for greater high rpm power. The result is intake tuning that is optimized for the engine's entire operating range.""

http://acuranews.com/acura-automobiles/channels/tlx-press-kit/releases/2018-acura-tlx-press-kit-powertrain

Second, the TLX 2.4 has a higher compression ratio compared to the last generation Accord 2.4. The TLX has a compression ratio of 11.6, compared to something like 10 for the Accord. I think there are some other differences with the Acura 2.4 as well. It definitely sounds better and more refined than the 2.4 in the last generation of Accord.

You almost certainly won't damage your Acura engine using regular (although personally I don't want to chance it with mine), but I don't think you are going to squeeze those extra 21 horses that the souped up TLX 2.4 has over the last generation of Accord 2.4. And imho you need every one of extra horses in some situations when you are accelerating a car that weighs 3500 pounds. Just my 2 cents. I like to drive a little fast and do somewhat sporty maneuvers sometimes, and the TLX works for that. The TLX is about a third of second faster to 60 than a base 320i, but that's not saying a lot. The TLX 2.4 needs all the power it has—and part of that is that the engine is optimized for premium gas. My guess is that the next generation TLX will have a 2-liter c. 290 hp turbo as standard—and so the current lower-powered, lower-priced (and higher mpg) TLX will be a thing of the past probably starting in 2020.

5510,sda,October 2018,"I'm sure the TLX sounds better, with a good engine note as it shifts through the gears than does the Accord with its CVT. The Accord is quick enough in most situations (who doesn't like more power?) but I don't find myself enthused to drive it hard very often and find myself accelerating in our Pilot a little more aggressively than I might to experience the engine sound as the transmission shifts gears. The V6 in the Pilot is typical Honda with a nice growl when you jump on it.

I actually found the ATS roomier up front than the M-B C-series when I was looking. The ATS cabin seems to have more width up front and to me feels a bit airier. Rear seat is perhaps a different story, but a driver and passenger are quite comfortable up front and are not rubbing elbows. The main issue is that the ATS is fairly low, which my knees are finding a bit challenging these days for getting in and especially out.

That's good information to have. I, too, felt cramped in a C-class.

Since it's usually just me in the car, rear seat space or elbow room isn't much of an issue.

""....Meanwhile, Lexus and Toyota topped the predicted new-vehicle reliability ranking for the sixth year in a row. Mazda jumped nine spots to finish third -- making it the most improved brand this year -- while Subaru, Kia, Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Mini and Hyundai rounded out the top 10.

Overall, Consumer Reports noted that when an automaker decides to make a vehicle more complicated, reliability often can dip as there are more things that can go wrong with a vehicle. Tesla, for example, made air suspension and all-wheel drive standard on the 2017 Model S, and it affected the car's reliability.

The nonprofit also highlighted the trend of automakers turbocharging smaller engines to give vehicles both pep and fuel economy -- with mixed results. Lexus has the most reliable turbo powertrain, followed by Honda and Porsche, while Hyundai and Mini have the most problematic ones, Consumer Reports said.

While automakers are adding more turbos, they're also increasingly pairing them with complicated transmissions that have upward of eight, nine and 10 gears, said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing.

""With this added complexity, it's not surprising to see some brands struggling to get them right, particularly the ones that don't have a long history of producing turbos,"" Fisher said in a release.

""....Meanwhile, Lexus and Toyota topped the predicted new-vehicle reliability ranking for the sixth year in a row. Mazda jumped nine spots to finish third -- making it the most improved brand this year -- while Subaru, Kia, Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Mini and Hyundai rounded out the top 10.

Interesting that Honda wasn't in the top 10? I thought they usually were? Hard to believe Mini, Audi, BMW and Hyundai were in the top 10 and they were not.

The nonprofit also highlighted the trend of automakers turbocharging smaller engines to give vehicles both pep and fuel economy -- with mixed results. Lexus has the most reliable turbo powertrain, followed by Honda and Porsche, while Hyundai and Mini have the most problematic ones, Consumer Reports said.
Hmmm. This seemingly ignores the Honda 1.5 turbo engine's woes that have been discussed at some length recently. Also not sure how Hyundai and Mini can have a troublesome turbo engine yet be ranked in the top 10 in overall reliability. Confusing.

That generation of 5 Series is not all that entertaining(M5 excepted); woolly steering and handling that was less than inspiring. To each his own, but light-years away from my cup of tea.
It's more luxury than sport, but a lot of both for someone like me who has been driving Accords for the last 16 years.

I had a friend in the 1990s who always got BMWs, and the seats on the 5-series he had were amazing. Iirc those seats were even slightly more comfortable and supportive than those in my 2018 Acura TLX with Milano leather. Anyway, I'm hoping that a BMW 5-series from 2015 has seats just as good as a BMW from the 1990s? And probably the handling of it would be fine for my tastes.

I do like how my TLX with 4-wheel steering handles. It's really great around corners.

Yeah, this is just on past models. Maybe the new ones will be better.

It's just that goofy (imho) survey that CR has its members fill out based on their own cars. I don't think it's really ""scientific,"" although I guess it is a large sample size. But there is a reason that Lexus and Toyota always end up at the top. That does seem to be based on something.

""Richard Truett: Why these three vehicles will get my NACTOY votes
October 23, 2018 @ 12:00 pm

....One vehicle I looked forward to driving was the Cadillac XT4 crossover. Now, to my eyes, that vehicle is nicely designed inside and out. I particularly like the instrument panel and its lower row of switches, shaped a bit like the famous Cadillac V used in some classic versions the brand's crest and wreath logo.

I didn't get far before I came to the conclusion that the XT4 doesn't deserve to wear a Cadillac badge.

The snarling 2.0-liter engine has the demeanor of an angry chainsaw running at full throttle. The suspension system was as subtle as a child's birthday party bounce house. Bottom line: Not class competitive, not even close. With the XT4, I wonder if GM ran out of funds to properly render a vehicle befitting the Cadillac badge?....

Now for some good surprises: There is no doubt in my mind that Hyundai has arrived as one of the world's elite automakers. The Genesis G70 sport sedan is a bona fide threat to BMW, Audi and Mercedes. The 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 is a rocket booster of an engine. The chassis is firm. The steering and brakes are dialed in perfectly.

Despite the copycat German influenced interior, the G70 was the best car I have tested this year....

Acura's RDX, despite having a schnoz inspired by the late comedian Jimmy Durante, is a terrific crossover — quiet, smooth, loaded with safety technology and equipped with a great sounding 2.0-liter turbo engine that is mated to a 10-speed automatic.

But the Jaguar I-Pace gets my vote as the utility of the year. It may have four doors and a higher ride height than a coupe, but it drives like a pure sports car. The torque from the twin electric motors is powerful and instant. The interior is typical Jaguar -- high quality and very stylish. True, the infotainment system can be fussy, but you forget that when you are driving. The I-Pace will get my vote for Utility of the Year....""

The Acura RLX sells in very small numbers—less than 1000 a year. Acura must have lost a lot of money of that car. It probably took at least a billion dollars to develop, and they they just updated it and so it's not dead yet. But I wonder if they will just kill the RLX in another few years if the trend toward SUVs continues. I guess it's a halo vehicle to allow them to compete with Mercedes, BMW, and Audi.

Iirc I think Shifty has said a few times over the years here, more or less, that if you buy an old high end car (after a mechanic takes a look at it, of course) you still probably need to figure on giving up on it if something truly major happens with the engine or transmission. But in the meantime you might get some great driving out of it—perhaps even for several years and many miles. Maybe that BMW wagon might even make it to 200k with maintenance and some minor work here and there.

Your 928 was a risky purchase, I have always liked them, was seriously looking at a 928GTS, but after a lot of investigating into the 928 and the high and I mean high cost of repairs (even at Indie shops) I moved away from it.

I've looking to into the BMW 550i (twin turbo V8) and know that the N63 engine (early years) had some serious problems, the later years with the N63TU engine, not so much.

Also looking at the MB E55 and E63, they have some issues, but not as serious as the 550i. Prices for the these are cars are reasonable, from 10K to as high as 35K.

ALso looking at BMW M5s, the E39 M5, not looking at the E60 M5 (even though having a V10 would be nice) I don't want to have spend 25K on an engine rebuild.

Porsche boxster is on my list, yes, IMS bearing is a problem, but the cost to take care of it after purchase is doable about $2500.

OR one could get a Lexus and not worry about these cost."

Here's the Porsche explanation of it.....

https://www.porsche.com/international/models/911/911-targa-4-models/911-targa-4s/chassis/rear-axle-steering/

""Rear-axle steering
Upon request, available for all S models: rear-axle steering. This enhances performance as well as suitability for the every day. For an especially light-footed handling with significantly improved drive stability.

Advantage in daily use: at low speeds, the system moves the back wheels against the front wheels in position. This results in a virtual shortening of the wheel position. The turning curve is reduced, the steering response in curves is significantly more dynamic and parking is easier – you will feel it.

Advantage when driving in a sporty style: at greater speeds the system steers the back wheels in the same direction as the front wheels, that are in position. Driving stability increases with the virtual increase in wheel position, the agility through the simultaneous steering of front and back wheels. In summary, it affects the maximum driving performance. We would say, rather positive!""

Yeah, the 2019 ILX is OK overall, but I think that's about it. The car has a good engine, a good transmission, good standard equipment, and good quality/reliability. And in a few months there will probably be nice discounts from the base $25,900 starting price. I think this is a way for a person who might be considering a new Corolla or Civic, etc. to move up for not that much more. Or maybe someone who is hoping for an affordable Audi A3 gets sticker shock at the c. $40k msrp and heads over to Acura instead? If you don't need something as large as a Camry or Accord, the 2019 ILX introductory lease is already about what you'd pay for the base models of those....

For someone wanting to avoid getting a turbo for whatever reason, this is one of the last ELL cars with a NA engine. Honda has probably come close to perfecting this 2.4 engine over about 20 years, and it's likely to last a long time. I think there are a fair number of Hondas and Acuras with earlier versions of this engine that have gone well over 250,000 miles.

But the bottom line is that there's a reason the TLX has recently outsold the ILX by something like 3 to 1. The TLX imho is a special car and a real luxury sports sedan. The ILX to be blunt is more like the fanciest, fastest, and highest tech 2015 Civic ever made.

Looks are subjective, but price is not. Each dealership has a ""set price range"" of certain models on the lot. Take BMW here in PHX, the average price of a 330i sedans is 47K, 340i's are about 7K more. That doesn't mean there aren't more or less expensive ones on the lot, but the average price sitting on the lots. I would assume Audi and MB are pretty close to those prices of the A4 and C300/400.

Some people are in love with the new Acura's I'm not, but I do like the new RDX. I just wish Acrura would stop playing games and build a true sport model of their cars, Honda as the Technology just build it.However, as I'm entering into later side of my 50's I'm looking for more comfort then sport. But we love our X2, it's everything the X1 is not sporty. I think this SAV has prompted me to go a smoother riding transportation."

If you ignore price I actually like the looks of the A3 slightly better than the new ILX, inside and out. But although the A3 theoretically begins at about $34k, the reality for my local dealer is that they don't have any A3 cars for less than an msrp of c.$41k. But Acura actually stocks the base models of its cars, and so soon you will actually be able to find a base ILX with its msrp of $25,900 at Acura dealers across the country.

Here's the Porsche explanation of it.....

https://www.porsche.com/international/models/911/911-targa-4-models/911-targa-4s/chassis/rear-axle-steering/

""Rear-axle steering
Upon request, available for all S models: rear-axle steering. This enhances performance as well as suitability for the every day. For an especially light-footed handling with significantly improved drive stability.

Advantage in daily use: at low speeds, the system moves the back wheels against the front wheels in position. This results in a virtual shortening of the wheel position. The turning curve is reduced, the steering response in curves is significantly more dynamic and parking is easier – you will feel it.

Advantage when driving in a sporty style: at greater speeds the system steers the back wheels in the same direction as the front wheels, that are in position. Driving stability increases with the virtual increase in wheel position, the agility through the simultaneous steering of front and back wheels. In summary, it affects the maximum driving performance. We would say, rather positive!""
You can order an Audi to specifications though, just have to wait 3 months for it. I'm convinced someone in Germany decides what all Audi dealers will get allocated unless an order is made. Too much similarity between dealerships.

One would assume this, however, every dealer orders their cars. I have a good friend who is a saleman for the Penskie Audi dealer here in PHX and have some interesting conversations with him. Just like BMW of North Scottsdale (penskie dealership and it's right next to the Audi dealer) the Audi dealership orders A4's and keeps the prices within a price point. Which means most are equipped about the same. Like BMW they have lower priced and higher priced A4s. OF course they are equipped for the mass population not the car enthuses this i why you want see a 340i w/ M sport package with 6 spd and MPPK or a A4 Premium Plus with just the sports package.

5649,benjaminh,October 2018,"A couple of days ago the oil life monitor on my leased Acura went from 30% to 20%, and so with about 6400 miles I went into my Acura dealer this morning at 7 am sharp without an appointment. To my amazement, after the crowds at the Honda dealer service bays starting well before opening, I was the first and only one in line. When my dealer leased the car they gave 2 years of maintenance on the house, and so I got an oil change and car wash for no charge today—and they even used ""Duramax"" synthetic oil. The details of the Acura oil life monitor don't really come through in this picture, but it's an old fashioned oil can like for the tin man in the Wizard of Oz. It's actually a full color cutaway (as I say not visible in the photo) which shows golden colored oil. The normal price of $65 seems a bit steep for an oil change, check of the car, washer fluid, car wash, vacuum, etc. but for long engine life changing the oil regularly with synthetic seems like a good idea. For ten dollars less they'll do regular oil. Nicer waiting area and snacks than the Honda dealer, and I was out in less than an hour.

No chance of doing that in the huge and crowded Honda dealer waiting area. They don't give you the option of adjusting the blaring TVs that I recall.

The available snacks at the Acura dealer are a small thing, but they are nice—premium coffee, premium tea, bottled water, a variety of snack bars, chips, etc. I got a small bottle of water to put in my car's cup holder and a nutrigrain bar for under the armrest. Was probably a fluke that I was the only one there, but it was peaceful and I got a bit of work done. I also feel like they were more focused on me and my car. When I took my wife's CR-V a week ago for an oil change the Honda dealer didn't remember to reset the oil monitor. That's only a small thing, and I reset it at home, but it seemed like maybe a lack of attention to detail?

I just checked their price list, and a regular oil change service at Huffman Acura at Oxmoor is $45—which is only five bucks more than the Honda dealer iirc. As I said, my service was ""free"", but I haven't yet figured out why the list price before they did the NC was $65. Doesn't add up if synthetic oil is only $10 more, but probably I missed some fine print somewhere.

I imagine the regular oil change would be fine once my free ones are done, but I do like the idea of a little extra insurance with the extra good oil. Probably in a few years I'll be dazzled by a new model of car, but right now I'm hoping I'll enjoy driving this TLX for several years to come.

When I did this research a while back, the BMW-USA website had a list of approved synthetic oils for the US market that was dated January 2008. It listed several brands, classifying all of them as oils with a “BMW long-life rating of LL-01.” The BMW LL-01 spec oil options listed were:


Castrol Syntec European Formula SAE 0w-30 (rumor has it that this is the oil BMW relabels to sell as BMW Genuine Oil SAE 5w-30 Synthetic Oil)


Mobil 1 SAE 0w-40


Penzoil Platinum European Formula Ultra SAE 5w-30


Valvoline SynPower SAE 5w-30


What happened between 2008 and 2013 to make BMW stop listing several oil manufacturer options? I have no idea. However, if you go to the Mobil Oil website, right now in 2013, the Mobil 1 0w-40 oil specs still list Mobil 1 0w-40 as being BMW LL-01 compliant.

I decided Mobil synthetic was worthy a few decades ago when our turbine engines (where I used to work) were always serviced with Mobil in accordance with MIL-L-23699. A gas turbine exercises oil to a level well in excess of what automobile engines see -- much higher temperatures, combined with the need to allow the engine to start at temperatures down to -40. So what is this LL-01 thing that Mobil can't meet?

For what it's worth, when we had to demonstrate starts at -65 deg F we used an Esso oil that met MIL-L-7808. It coked up more at high temperatures but performed better at low temperatures.

The way most, if not all, of the cars used by the people on these boards are used, the oil you use is going to be fine. Pretending that you use the engine to the extent that the oil choice matters is, I guess, what makes the internet what it is.

If you found a car that was a good deal and in good shape outside of the leather seats, you can certainly get new leather put in for no more than $1,500. And it's generally nicer quality than most anything that comes standard from the factory.

Now, generally, abused seats like that are simply a reflection of overall care, so it's unlikely that's the only need.

If you pay $6 or $7 thousand for a nice clean used truck, you really don't want to spend $1,500 on seat covers. Seems somehow ... disproportional. Not that you're going to find many clean used trucks in that price range any more. That used to be fairly easy to do, but not any more.

My comments about the Ford truck leather seats is based on my personal experiences. I have looked at quite a few used trucks, 10 or 12 years old, reasonable miles, Ford and Chevy and GMC. Higher end Chevy and GMC trucks, the leather seats were almost always in good shape. On Fords, 9 out of 10 were shot, torn to h___.

All of which is not a scientific survey, and someone else might have had exactly the opposite experience.

I will add that the King Ranch Ford trucks use an entirely different leather, and I have never seen a King Ranch with the seats torn up.

Which is really $439/mo when you amortize the cap reduction.

A $791 dealer discount on an almost $39k car is laughably small - we routinely tell folks to target 7% off sticker, before incentives, and some folks have reported getting more than that.

The 320i goes away for 2019, so you should be able to do much better than the national offer. And, that is a true statement for just about every brand.

Have you ever wondered why things happen when they do? How many time have you gone to the store, got what you needed, return to your car and drove home! Well for me, thousands of time, but this time, some wacko took a baseball bat to my car, of course, I didn't have my cell phone with me, but lucky the store had camera's that caught it all, and there were police arresting someone for shoplifting. The derange man also got 2 other cars, I'm sure my car will be totaled. Both A Pillars, roof, both fender, hood, windshield, lights (LED), drivers and rear passenger doors, and all glass. Lucky for the video, and yes, the police tazzed the guy and handcuffed him. I'm driving the X2, but that doesn't belong to us any longer, my niece came into town for the holidays and LOVED the X2 and we did a lease swap on it, but she comes back on Friday to drive the it home.

I guess things happen for a reason, I have been fighting with BMW to fix me car, when the car sits over night and when you go start it, it's lurches/jumps like its not in neutral all the way. BMW says my car is fine and is normal, in BMW speak, no codes are being thrown so we aren't worrying about it. I'm sure if I told them I lost confidence in the car things would be different, so this 330 is my last NEW BMW. So what to get, it will be used, looked at two MB E63's both one owner cars have to say, they are FAST, and the V8 rumble is addicting. So the fun starts.

So criteria for the new car, used, max price $25K.

I've been looking into the E55/63 cars as well as the E39 E60 M5's. Most cars have had the major issues taken care of and each car listed has a few, the engine and transmission of the MB have been pretty much bullet proof prices are all over the place on them. I'm aware of the engine issues of the E60 M5, to fix the issue before the bearings go bad is about 3K, and the Vanoas seals would need to be replaced, that is the two issues with the V10.

I think when you go and purchase a used M car or AMG car you need to do your homework, that I have done. Other then the items I have mentioned there are no real issue with the car, yes, keeping up on maintenance is important, but commute has been cut to 12 miles RT.

I’m definitely not seeing that. I just checked the web page for the closest Infiniti dealer. They have a lease special up for a 2019 Infiniti Q50 3.0t Luxe -- $299 a month for 39 months (no mention of miles), with $5,099 due at signing. $5,099 divided by 39, that’s another $131 a month, so for a sign-and-drive you’re looking at $430 per month against a retail price of $39,295. And that does not include tax, title, and license.

That wasn't the manufacturer (Infiniti), that was the closest Infiniti dealer, on their web site. They had some decent deals on buying a new car or SUV, but terrible deals on leasing. Possibly because no one (or almost no one?) leases a car in Texas?

I work with a lot of people who make good money (in some cases, great money), and some of them drive very nice cars. Probably half of them drive older or less expensive cars, and spend all of their money on other things, houses, college tuition, you know the drill.

But among the ""car"" group, I only know of one who is leasing, a very nice Lexus SUV. And at the time she got that SUV, she was dating someone who worked at the dealership.

5767,breld,March 2019,"Agree with all the previous posts on ""luxury.""

There are a lot of subtle (sometimes not so subtle) enhancements that you generally get out of a luxury make - nicer materials for one, often in places like the headliner, storage compartments, etc. Switches and button are also an area that seem to receive greater attention. Then there are things that often come along with luxury makes like a smoother drivetrain.

A better dealership experience is generally part of it too.

My thought is the luxury makes do offer something additional for the extra cost of the vehicle, and it's up to the buyer to determine whether those things are of particular value to them.

I believe this is the “greater fool” theory. If someone can be fooled into believing the marketing hype and pay $80K for a (an?) SUV, they certainly can be fooled into paying some more money for options that are standard on a lot of mainstream brands.

There is a difference between factory turbo and some stage 10 kit you got of an website. However, it is to be seen how those turbos will perform at 100K+ miles. I read Ford vehicles suffer from reliability issues with their ""Ecoboost"" turbo engines, but I'm not sure what kind of reliability problems these are. Sometimes it may be electrical/computer trouble that has nothing to do with engine stress, more with crappy software or even crappier electrical components. Those can kill engines (or at least owner's enthusiasm) way before the combustion pressure can.

A tune is a tune--it's going to put more wear on your car even if well-engineered. Warranties are great, but they don't keep cars from breaking. If you buy hi-performance, there's always a trade off and you have to up your maintenance game, too."
5800,ab348,April 2019,"My point is that with a naturally aspirated engine you need to do lots of mechanical work to make more power - heads, pistons, intake, fuel system, etc. As it comes from the factory there is usually lots of margin or capacity left. A modern D.I. turbo engine removes much of that margin to get more power from a smaller engine. It is much more highly stressed, not only structurally on things like pistons and rings and bearings but also much more sensitive to oil life, adequate cooling, etc. Adding a tune exacerbates that.
2017 Cadillac ATS Performance Premium 3.6"

5807,henryn,April 2019,"I remember a few years back, in the Ford diesel truck forums, there was a debate about the oil pressure gauge. Most everyone had noticed that those gauges never showed anything but 5/8 of full pressure. An engineer (you know how engineers are) performed some tests and reported back that there were only two possible readings from that gauge. -- ""0"" (no reading) or ""5/8 scale"". As you varied the resistance to ground, the needle would jump from 0 to 5/8. No other readings were possible.

5808,cdnpinhead,April 2019,"Thank you -- I rest my case. My baseline is my MG's Smith instruments that displayed oil pressure, coolant temperature and (head for the fainting couch) an ammeter, which involved heavy wiring in and out of the instrument panel, plus the obligatory fuel level. Anyway, they all read real stuff, and were quite helpful in monitoring the health (or lack thereof) of my little '65 MGB as I drove it through 44 states and six provinces in the late '60s and early'70s. I even added an oil temperature gauge, which was connected via a hollow tube to a bulb that inserted into a fitting that I had brazed into the oil pan during one of the several times I had the engine down. This is how I learned that it takes most of an hour or two for the oil to reach a stable temperature when the ambient temperature is below zero, for those of you who wonder why your fuel mileage sucks in the winter.

Good times.

Yes, I'm a pi$$ed-off old man, but my TSX has well over 150K miles on it and is still fun to drive, even though it only displays fuel level, RPM and speed (along with about 17 lighted symbols that come on during startup, and hopefully go back off).

When Audi did a travelling ""Experience"" drive with their own cars long ago (1st generation manual R8's and S5's), they told people to put in in 3rd gear, and keep it there, bouncing off the limiter, I think that limited speeds to the double digits maximum.

might be relevant if you are driving flat out on a track. In normal driving, even the rare spirited back road type, I bet most people (including me) don't push the envelope to that extreme, so the fraction of a second difference is meaningless. But the tactile experience and sense of control isn't. ATs are IMO much more likely to spend time trying to hold a much too high gear, or hunting around for the right one, than they are to be snapping off powershifts at the redline.

They are more relaxing in stop and go traffic though. Not that lightning quick gear changes matter much in that use!

But, here in CO, it's nice to use them to downshift on slippery roads when you're going downhill and want to avoid the brakes.

On cars that I've had, when you are in Sport, it will hold the gear, and not revert to drive. Although different vehicles have different methods to handle ""out of range"" issues. Older cars would bounce off the rev limiter, holding the gear, while others would automatically upshift at red-line.

Almost all of them will act like a regular automatic, if you go too slow for the gear.

might be relevant if you are driving flat out on a track. In normal driving, even the rare spirited back road type, I bet most people (including me) don't push the envelope to that extreme, so the fraction of a second difference is meaningless. But the tactile experience and sense of control isn't. ATs are IMO much more likely to spend time trying to hold a much too high gear, or hunting around for the right one, than they are to be snapping off powershifts at the redline.

They are more relaxing in stop and go traffic though. Not that lightning quick gear changes matter much in that use!
Lighting quick gear changes probably help contribute to the superior fuel economy though.

Audi mastered the dual clutch as of 2006.... with the '06 A3. 106,000 miles on that puppy before I sold it, and the next owner took it to over 150K miles.
Anecdotal evidence is just that, anecdotal. And even if none of them blew up, that still wouldn't mean they had ""mastered the dual clutch"". If the driving experience was not what most of the owners wanted or expected, then you couldn't really say ""mastered"".

Well, I think the ""satisfaction"" rating for A3 owners was VERY high. Also, there's a lot of high-mile A3's running around, so they must have done something right.

I would say reviews were ""mixed"" on the DSG, but a well-trained and calibrated DSG worked wonders in my opinion. Yes, the transmissions were trainable,and had a ""learning"" computer ""brain."" It's important to note they work like a manual, not like an automatic. I personally like the mechanical feel, whereas some people call it a ""lurch"" upon stopping.

Yes, the TLX's 2.4 is direct injected....

https://acuranews.com/acura-automobiles/channels/tlx-press-kit/releases/2018-acura-tlx-press-kit-powertrain

2.4-Liter Engine i-VTEC® Valve Control System
The TLX's direct-injected 2.4-liter DOHC 16-valve i-VTEC® engine uses an advanced valve-control system to combine high power output with high fuel efficiency and low emissions. The system combines VTC (Variable Timing Control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves.

At low rpm, the VTEC intake valve timing and lift are optimized for high torque and low fuel consumption. As engine rpm builds past 4,900 rpm, the VTEC system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.

The ""intelligent"" portion of the system is its ability to continuously vary the timing of the intake cam relative to that of the exhaust camshaft. This helps boost power and also provides a smoother idle (allowing idle speed to be reduced). The intake cam timing is varied based on input from sensors that monitor rpm, timing, throttle opening, cam position and exhaust air-fuel ratio. The result is increased fuel efficiency and lower NOx emissions.

Agree. And so you like yours now?

The TLX is a really good car for the money. And for me the most impressive feature is maybe the standard 4-wheel steering, which is something that's optional on a Porsche that costs more than twice as much. The ELS stereo is also quite good.

On the other thread there's the quote for the Infiniti Q50 for $487 a month, and my guess is that for significantly less you could get a loaded V-6 TLX. With the incentives like they are now you can lease a TLX 2.4 for less than an Accord EXL.

That 487 is first pencil with zero negotiation ... I am sure that can be 410-425 with some haggling. In all reality for a not too savvy shopper it comes pretty close to the 1% rule and I'd bet many people would sign the deal.

I realize you're right that the 3-series of today is as big as the 5-series of a couple of decades ago, making it seem like a better deal.

5910,benjaminh,August 2019,"This review of 26,000 miles of ownership in a Tesla Model 3 says that compared to a similar gas car he's saved about $2000 by using electricity instead of gasoline. But the Telsa Model 3 with a few options is, as he says, a $50,000 car on which you can't get any discounts. Because of big discounts and lease incentives I paid close to $30,000 for my more luxurious TLX. With that $20,000 difference there's no way even at 2k in fuel savings a year that you'll come out ahead. And I don't drive 26k miles a year, but more like 14k. And so the fuel savings would maybe be more like $1200. Plus my guess is that by the time he gets to 100,000 miles, if he keeps the Model 3 that long, he might need to replace the batteries, which might be a c. $10,000 repair, while with maintenance and good luck the engine and transmission on a TLX might go past 200k without major repairs. The TLX has environmental costs, but so does getting rid of or trying to recycle a huge number of Tesla batteries. The bottom line is that the costs for long-term ownership still favors the TLX big a big margin as far as I can see. I see the appeal, but the math just doesn't seem to add up unless you are so well off that costs aren't really a significant factor....

The extended range Model 3 can go c.300 miles, which is sort-of ok. But once it's empty even at a Supercharger it takes over an hour to get close to a full recharge—compared to a fill-up of an ICE car at a gas station that takes at most ten minutes.

It’s maybe a tick faster than my 2 Series, but the xDrive filters the fun too much for my tastes. I scared a friend quite a bit accelerating through a corner flat out when he thought I was going to lift and brake.

I like the latest generation of iDrive, but it’s considerably different from what I’m used to.
The voice recognition works quickly and accurately.
The base sound system is surprisingly good. I’d still want to audition the H-K upgrade, but the standard system is no slouch.
It’s still too big for my tastes, but the car masks its bulk to an impressive degree.
An M240i with the M340i cockpit, 382 hp motor, and M Sport diff would be just about perfect for me.

I still have 2 years left on the lease for my Acura TLX. But maybe after that? Probably not. I'm more likely to buy the TLX for 18.5k at that point.

But the Tesla Model 3 does seem like it's a really good car. After watching all these videos my doubts about it are slowly falling away. The big thing I wonder about is what happens with the batteries after ten years....

And....

""Model 3 with Long-Range Battery - 8 years or 120,000 miles, whichever comes first, with minimum 70% retention of Battery capacity over the warranty period.""

But that still seems like it means that at somewhere around ten years Tesla expects the batteries to wear out. At that point the car is out of warranty and loses most of its resale value. A ten year old Acura in good shape, on the other hand, might still have ten more years of life without major repairs.

I don't think so. It's much more likely US sales will revert closer to Q1 numbers than maintain Q2 numbers. Anybody, who read what Tesla actually had to do to get to those Q2 numbers would know there was a lot of one-time moves, just like Q4 of last year. I think a much more likely number is missing 200k target by a small margin. Much more interesting to me is how many new EV buyers are left in the current market. Those who wanted one, got it (most of them anyway) and they can pray to it, if that's their fancy. Now it's about people like myself - I have the money, I COULD buy it even at current prices, if I wanted to. There are aspects about those vehicles that I like and respect, but I'm not even considering it at this point. One reason is I'm not completely convinced Tesla will be around in five years, or to be more precise, I think the probability of complete failure of the company is significantly higher than zero (in mathematical terms ""non-trivial""). I can't ignore this in my calculus. That's on top of the lack of energy portability that's offered in gasoline engine. It could do well as a second vehicle in the house, but simply I have no space for two vehicles.

5922,benjaminh,August 2019,"https://loupventures.com/tesla-model-3-cost-of-ownership-slightly-cheaper-than-a-camry/

""Average all-in cost per mile for a Model 3 is $0.46, compared to the Camry LE at $0.49, and Audi A5 at $0.80.""

This study claims to show that a Tesla Model 3 costs less over 5 years than a Toyota Camry, which is shocking.

But I don't agree with some of the numbers that were used. For instance, it says that maintenance and repairs for a Camry over 5 years will be about $4000, but my guess is that it would be about half of that (10 oil changes x $50 each =$500 + 4 tires for c.$1000 + 500 additional would be my estimate). The Tesla model was c. $39k on which no discounts are possible, but with a Camry for c.$25k you might get $4000 off of msrp, which they didn't indicate. So I feel like the study is about $6000 off in favor of the Tesla. Finally, although the Tesla battery has a 8 years/100,000 mile warranty, I'm wondering if you own the Tesla for 10 years and 150,000 or more miles if a new $8000 or so battery is likely to be needed.

Still, the bottom line is that the economics may possibly be shifting toward electrics, and specifically Tesla. There's no doubt that a Tesla is cheaper over 5 years than their other comparison, which was an Audi A5. And now Elon Musk says that starting next year the design life of the battery for the Model 3 will more than double:

https://electrek.co/2019/04/23/tesla-battery-million-miles-elon-musk/

If this pans out, this means that in a year or two the batteries of a Teslas Model 3 will be able to last maybe as much as 500,000 miles. The electric motors for a Tesla are already likely to last at least 500,000 miles, because well-designed electric motors are inherently longer lasting than most internal combustion engines.

Plus there are no oil changes etc. For high-mileage drivers the Tesla might become a top choice, because the cost per mile driven would almost certainly be quite low.

I've gone from being a Tesla skeptic to someone who thinks there might be something to this.

5924,stickguy,August 2019,"there are still limits to a full electric that would prevent me from getting one. Unless it was really cheap (as opposed to really expensive, which they are), and I truly just needed a 2nd car for pure local duty.

the problem is, they are expensive, and we can only afford one car in that high price range, and it will be the one we take on trips. So, the train ain't meeting on this one! No way I am taking one on say Christmas eve trip at 10 PM across the boondocks of NYS, in usually crappy weather, and have to be trying to find a charging station in an area I would really prefer not to stop in! Or get out to charge then sit there for 2 hours while it does.

even worse if you can't afford more than say a leaf or Bolt. Not a suitable family truckster travel car anyway.

5925,benjaminh,August 2019,"With discounts the two of us got our TLXs for c. $30k, and these cars have a c.450 mile range per tank in mixed driving. The ""long-range"" Tesla Model 3 has a range of c.300 miles, and it costs about $48k and has no discounts. If we keep them, our TLXs should be able to last with good maintenance and a bit of luck well over 200,000 miles. The interior luxury of a TLX looks to me like it's beyond a Model 3.

The long-range $48k Tesla seems out of my price range. But over 10 years and 150,000 miles it might be less per mile driven than even a TLX 2.4. But over the three years of our lease I think we are way ahead. And my guess is that over 5 years we will be ahead too.

In terms of range anxiety, there's a video that makes some sense that says that gas engines produce just as much range anxiety as a Tesla. His argument is basically that because you each day charge your Tesla at home and/or at work up to maybe 250 miles or so of charge, and never have to stop even at a Supercharge station, you never have range anxiety in normal driving of commuting and shopping around town. With a gas engine, however, you do have to think about filling up so that you don't run out of gas.

On a trip with a Tesla there is some range anxiety, but that's minimized by the Tesla Supercharger network. The included Tesla trip software calculates out your trip and guides you exactly to each recommended Supercharger based on your car's range. A long trip in a Tesla is slower because of the c. 45 minute or so charging times, but since often we need to stop for a meal and a little sight-seeing every 250 miles or so anyway, it's not as much of a slowdown as we might expect....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvb7gV0GRNE&amp;t=544s

I still love my Acura. But I'm beginning to hope that by the time I get my next car that Acura will just buy some of Tesla's tech and also buy access to the Supercharger network. Elon Musk apparently said quite a while ago that he'd be ok with selling to another car maker access to the Supercharger network, but that so far no one has taken him up on it.

5926,stickguy,August 2019,"well, I am not buying that logic! driving around local means gassing up once a week or 2. and there are stations everywhere, so if you are getting low you just swing into one, and 5 minutes later gassed up and on your way.

but in the same usage, an EV would not concern me. It really is travelling that does it. and we don't normally stop much. gas if going 400+ miles (well, in my car, 300 in the RDX!), otherwise just a quick pit stop for bathroom and stretch, and if eating it will be a quick food place. and driving in rural areas at weird times, which we do, is really not going to be comfortable in an EV.

Kind of a moot point anyway for us, because we can't afford the EV equivalent of the car we would like to have as our one nice set of wheels!

5927,benjaminh,August 2019,"I think I agree with all of your points for now.

But if Elon's predictions pan out, in 2 more years (when my lease is up) I might be able to get a Model 3 that has a 400 mile range, charges in half the time of current models (in other words, takes about 20 minutes to go from 20% charge to 80%), and lasts the rest of my life—even if I drive all over the country multiple times—with minimal maintenance and no gas.

But since I'm already 54, I think my Acura TLX could well last till I'm 70—if I make it to that age.

There is no shortage of music from any era. The problem is that stations both OTA and satellite maintain limited playlists based on criteria they believe will keep the majority of their listeners happy. I have several thousand tunes from my preferred era to choose from and keep hundreds of them on USB for use in the car. Mix them up every so often, dropping ones I get tired of and adding others, and create new playlists when I do. Don't ever listen to radio now.

I have no desire to seek out new music because most of it leaves me cold. An affliction of my age.

Would it make economic sense for me to try to get a $40k Tesla Model 3 instead? Doesn't seem like it, unless I'm missing something. Although the TLX will cost c. $1500 more each year in gas and maintenance compared to a Model 3, even over ten years that doesn't come close to erasing the nearly $22k difference.

If, however, by July of 2021 Acura has an electric car that has an msrp of maybe $38k it might make sense. First, my guess is that unlike a Tesla that goes for full msrp you might get a discount on an electric Acura. And then you'd get the federal tax credit of $7500 that has already almost expired for Tesla. Between the two of those things it might make sense for me to go electric—if it's Acura or Honda.

But if I end up keeping the TLX that would be fine with me, because so far I love driving it.

I don't really see any cost cutting. However, it does seem the S is now a rental fodder model trim line, the SE used to be loaded, but is now sort of the base model replacing what the S used to be, and the SEL is now the loaded up tarted model, but still not every bell and whistle, which is either the SEL R-Line or SEL Premium line.

My wife just got a Tiguan SEL 4-Motion, and it's pretty darn good and loaded. I'd say it's overpriced, but not with a giant discount we were able to negotiate. It was based on the ""Costco"" deal, which is super aggressive, and I was happy having it matched. Some dealerships wouldn't ""match it"" and claimed there were probably ""catches"" to it. Other than having to listen to (waste time) the finance guy sales spiel trying to sell warranty on a 6 year 72K bumper to bumper warranted car, not really any ""catches"" at all.

Digital HD cluster gauges in SEL trim. Once you get that, you never go back. Pano roof. A very nice leatherette, especially in interior gray color. We got the Stone Blue (sort of a grayish bluish hint of green) with the gray interior, a nice combo. Her first choice was ice silver which is like a super light almost white nardo gray, but that seems to have been discontinued as a color. One salesman suggested Audi wanted the color.

8 speed auto, 2.0T motor tuned for 87 octane. Lots of room vertically and length-wise. Good looking well-designed SUV!

The 6-year 72K mile bumper to bumper warranty is almost guaranteed to be used and come in handy, even if it were a Honda, which it isn't! It's also a TRANSFERABLE warranty so it's not a gimmick like Hyundai/Kia where the warranty is only good for the first owner. I will say the Alltrack was problem free for 31K miles.

Wife says she got the 4-motion because it felt and drove better than the 2-wd model which she tested back to back. Says the AWD felt lighter/peppier, probably due to better acceleration, even in the dry. Something about the feel of AWD, which she said reminded her of the Alltrack drive, which is a good thing.

And so that right there more than erases the difference. And if you're really looking at lowest ownership costs over ten years, my guess is that a Camry hybrid, Accord hybrid, or Sonata hybrid will beat the Model 3 by a significant margin over ten years. Hmmm. The Tesla 3 is still an awesome and appealing vehicle, but it has a highway range of 250 miles, while my Acura TLX has a highway range of over 550 miles using the EPA rating, and since I often get c. 3-4 mpg over the epa rating in the real world, my actual highway range is about 600.

66% RV after 5 years on the model 3? And 40% at 10 yrs? HAHAHAHAHA
ALG apparently puts the RV of the model 3 after 5 years at 31%. 31% is almost certainly too low, but 66% seems too high. In any case, after 10 years the RV on a model 3 is maybe going to be at most 30%, which means that the calculation is off by another $4000 or so in saying that a Tesla model 3 is as cheap to own in the long run as a Camry.

Also missing from the calculation is the cost of the Tesla home charger, which costs $500, with maybe an additional $500 to install. So that's another $1k where this calculation is off.

The bottom line is that the model 3, rather than being around $2k less expansive than a Camry over 10 years, is probably closer to being $6k more expensive.

But, if you compared a Tesla with a Mercedes A220 or BMW 3-series, it seems like the Tesla might come out on top in terms of 10 year costs.

Yes, it shares the same platform with the G70. The Stinger is a bit bigger than the G70 but I think it looks much more interesting. And the current lease incentive is $10k- at least on 2019 models. On one Stinger forum there is a thread devoted to the process of leasing the car and then buying out the lease.

My local dealers have several of $39.5K-40.5K A4s in their stock (within 50 miles), so it is possible to get one if you really want it (I wouldn't). In upscale German brands equipment levels is mostly a decision of a local dealer's inventory manager (within model allotments) and their view of the market. I've been following BMW's inventory at my local dealers once every so often and they can't be any different from each other. For example, one dealer may have majority of strippers ready for low-end leases, another may have mostly fully loaded stuff for 20 grand more. They may say they order ""what sells"", but nobody will convince me that markets 20 miles apart are so different from each other than you'll sell only white cars here and black cars there. It's all what these guys think sells and what they personally think looks nice and fits. It's all their taste and ""feel"". Then they sell it and as long as they hit their target, their confirmation bias will tell them they made correct decisions. If they don't, they'll blame slowdown, four seasons, drought, snow, rain, wrong Moon phase and current president of the United States. I don't think there is any science there at all.

Kia's MSRPs are pure fantasies drawn by accountants in the beginning of the model, later brought to reality, just like domestic manufacturer's.

I like long standard equipment and short comprehensive packaging approach in Acura (Lexus and Infiniti are much more elaborate). My only beef is that their model lineup is short (no hatchbacks, wagons, or any other ""special"" type of vehicle) and their color combinations are very limited in comparison with Germans. They are all about playing it safe, whereas Germans are willing to take chances, make some special models for individuals with ""off-beat"" tastes, and pare it back when necessary. I haven't seen Acura taking any real chances in their model lineup, Lexus made some efforts in high end performance range, but generally they are all a bit too oriented for the average buyer in that segment.

Similarly priced (MSRP) BMW 3-series (essentially entry level 330) even at higher residual (say 61%,, and lower MF, say 0.00142), if gotten with say $4K off the sticker would probably be slightly more. However, load that bimmer up to get similar equipment and performance and you're adding at least couple of hundred bucks.

6008,benjaminh,February 2020,"I think the big Stinger incentives are for 2019 models, but for the Acura TLX it's for the 2020s. And so on the other hand you might consider a 2020 TLX V-6 with super-handling AWD for c. $400 a month with $2500 down, although for that you need to currently have either an Acura or another luxury brand on their list.

I like that. Didn't think of it, but it sounds like an interesting plan. You'll still suffer lousy depreciation, but at least it's mitigated by the huge upfront discount and the buyout can save you some finance charges, if you use cash. If you don't have cash, then it may be better to let the lease run its course unless you can get a really low interest loan, like 2%. What are top tier open market rates for 36-48 month loans now?

Any evidence it's a widespread problem?
Evidence #1: It happened to me, and I don't feel particularly lucky or unlucky, I generally assume what happens to me is what happens in general. I'm usually right.

Evidence #2: The whole Finance lease return rules, regulations, and contract (as written by Kia Finance) is fatally flawed, incompetently flawed, and rigged to benefit them, with no recourse for the customer to challenge inaccuracies short of a CSI tracking system.

Evidence #3: Dealership said they didn't lose a Key FOB in 7 years. Makes it odd they'd burn a customer over $350 if it only happens once every 7 years, seems like a small price to pay that wouldn't dent their bottom line. What's more likely? That it happens weekly, and $350/week would put a dent in their bottom line, and therefore that's why they don't want to pay it.

Evidence #4: Kia Finance's whole system of billing and collecting on faulty charges reeks odor. They've done this before. They seem confident they are correct.

Bottom line is I find their ""evidence"" no more credible than mine, and I knows whos is right and correct.

54K MSRP. I'm thinking you get this below invoice (50,726) so let's say selling price is $49500.

The payment here in NJ with tax and only first payment OOP is $670. Acq fee is $595, 450 doc, 400 Reg

I like the Stinger a lot, but for nearly $700 I'd be forced to look at other options if I was set on leasing.

That's what I'm considering doing with the 2019 GTS I found It's just crazy.

It makes sense and is easy enough to do.

I did it on a Passat a while back. And a friend of my wife's wanted a Kona last year - the incentives were significant but specific to a lease, so I helped her get the lease done and then she bought it out within a month or two.

Lease incentives on my V90 XC were similar to the Stinger deal, to the point I got nearly $20k off MSRP. As with the Kia, the money factor equates to an interest rate around 5%, so I've considered buying out the lease to reduce the interest expense. I may still do it, but with average rates around 3.5%, it doesn't actually save a lot of money, and I lose the risk reduction with being under a lease.

Ha! Funny, my calculation is the following:

I think they might win the argument in Court that my beef is with the Dealership, not with Kia Finance (though nothing is guaranteed).

My calculation is I'm not suing anyone for less than 4 figures, and $350 falls below my threshold to take the Dealership to small claims court.

My calculation is that Kia Finance nor their collectors will sue me for less than 4 figures either, and $350 will fall below their threshold.

We will just all agree to hate each other, and there will be no suing. If there is suing, I'll sue. Let the games begin, but I'll let them throw the first punch.

I suppose the credit score keepers are in the pocket of the banks...... but at least there, there is a system in place to dispute inaccuracies. You can probably thank the Democrats for this Consumer protection. One of the good things they have done, as was HARP 2.0. (though CASH4CLUNKERS and bailouts were an abomination).
